N", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Wild Arms 2, like most sequels, would have the incredibly hard task of following the series dynamite debut back in 1997. While many think that sequels never attain the level of the original (thus the theory of diminishing returns) Wild Arms 2 holds up pretty well overall, but doesn't really break any new ground for the series.Graphically, Wild Arms 2 pretty much follows in the path of its predecessor in that the game has it high and lows. Environments such as towns, dungeons and world map are now completely 3D, unlike the first game, and are very well done with lots of detail - as one would expect a last generation PSX title. Unfortunately, like the original, the graphics in the battle scenes are still behind the times (that's somewhat of an understatement). While they are better than first game's, you can tell that this element of the game probably recieved the least attention from the development team. While they're not horrible, it leaves you wondering what could have been.Story-wise, Wild Arms 2 delivers another interesting and engrosing tale as the original did, even though this time it does take a little but longer for things to get rolling, but not to the point as in Star Ocean: The 2nd Story. However, once the story gets going, their is no turning back (the story is the main reason I like this game the way I do - it has some great twists).Character development is strong as well, but not as strong as in the first installment. This is probably due to the fact you get 6 characters (1 is hidden) in this game in contrast to having just three characters in the first game. Having more characters means having less time to spend developing each one, but is a VERY welcome change from the first game and is a trade-off that works in favor of the game. I only wish that they empolyed this in Wild Arms 3.As for battle system, Wild Arms 2 ditches magic points in exchange for the force point system. Overall, this works pretty well, but they're are more than a few occasions where you wish your abilties used MP instead FP. This is especially apparent when fighting the optional foes. Due to the fact a character loses all their FP when knocked out, their are points you'll find you can't defend or cast anything upon revival until you build up more FP. More often than not against the optional foes, they'll knock you into subbmission before you can build your FP back up. This isn't as big of problem with fighters as it is with mage-type characters, who rely on thier FP to cast spells.Wild Arms 2 is also the hardest out of the three Wild Arms games. There is no duplication trick like the first game and you CANNOT buy Goat Dolls (an automatic revive upon knock-out item) as in Wild Arms. This and the situaution with the force points system makes the extra boss battles in Wild Arms 2 much harder than anything found in Wild Arms and Wild Arms 3. Basically, there is no easy solutions to some of the optional battles in WA2, you just gotta use pure skill, or dumb luck.While not an amazing game or sequel, Wild Arms 2 is well crafted game worthy of any RPG freak or gamer's playing hours.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not as strong as the original, but still very enjoyable...", "unixReviewTime": 1099526400, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2004"}

I am not sure why I am reviewing this game now, but it might have something to do with the fact that I am playing it again, and am almost done with it.Pros: Putting this as simple as possible, this game is by far one of the most \"interesting\" rpg's I have ever played...right behind Vagrant Story. The cinematic videos in this game are wonderful, and are fun to watch. There are six characters to choose from and play with throught the game, instead of just three from the original. On top of that, you get to play with one of the guardians, the gardian of desire, in one part of the game. In part one, there was a story about the blade of disaster, and the legendary sword maggess, and in this game, you get to actually use her for a short period. This game has alot of history and story in it. The game time to finish, is around 35 to 40 hours, if you rush through it. You will generally finish at about level 47 with your main character. If you want to finish the game, beating everything and leveling up completely, you will be at 99 hours plus, and will take you such a long time, that you probably will not want to finish it that way. This gives alot of diversity to the gamers...it just depends on what type of gamer you are. The new battle system dealing with Fighting Points(FP), is unique, and never been tried before in any game. And, all the characters specialize in such unique techiniques, it will be hard to choose who your main party of three will be.Cons: The graphics dealing with the world have been lessened from the original. The music is not as breathtaking as the original, but still good. And, the puzzles are not nearly as hard as the first game. In the original Wild Arms, there was a place called, De Le Metalica, and within this place, the puzzles were so hard, you wanted to quit before finishing it. In this game, there are a few hard puzzles, and a couple impossible ones, but the only way to get to them, is to go out of your way, and spend time working on things that are not required to beat the game. To find hidden bosses..etc.Overall, this game is wonderful. I am about 10 hours away from beating this game with everything done. I am at level 97 and all my characters are incredibly high in power. When I finish this task, I am open to any questions about the game, anyone has. I have found many things that the strategy guides don't have. (The only reason I am using one...is because I have already beat this game about 15 times) I won't help you unless you are really stuck. :) ENJOY!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not as breathtaking as the original, but i still love it!", "unixReviewTime": 1033948800, "reviewTime": "10 7, 2002"}

In a lot of other RPGs, characters other than main ones are considered as 'sub-characters' and they usually stay in your party for certain length.  But instead, so-called 'sub's are as important to the game as the main ones.I thought the game captured a lot of human dramas such as 'love', 'trust', 'friendship' and 'importantce of each individual'.  I really liked the way each character's personality was revealed and developed throughout the game.  This includes finding out about their own identity, strengths and weaknesses, what friends are for and many others.In terms of gameplay, it is reletively easier than the first WA.  3D rotation enables you to view the map from different angles which helps to find hidden secrets.  This concept is very similar to Dragon Warrior 7.I found puzzles very easy and hardly had any trouble getting through any of them.  I think the puzzles from WA1 are lot harder and clever than WA2.Music is slightly better than the last one, but it still sounds repeatitive especially when you are solving puzzles.  Animated movies are played each time you load the game, which are different depending on which disc you are on.Personal skills are very useful when you are struggling with certain bosses but they are relatively easy to beat.  The other new feature is a player can decide whether or not to go into battles with some exceptions.  This can be very useful when you want to get through the dungeon or get to certain places more quickly but the downside of it is, it can become a bad habbit, therefore you may need to spend a quite a lot of time building up your characters.It is very shameful that the game does not support analog controller, although it could make things a little bit more difficult at certain spots.This game has very good storyline and the gameplay is easy to learn.

While I could never seem to find the first one, I managed to find this one.  While I liked WA3 a lot, this one wasn't as good I thought.  True the gameplay elements are top-notch and all, but where it gets annoying are the themes outside the gameplay.First of all, these characters are actually nicely developed. Something that I didn't very much expect from this game. They were brilliantly done.  However, the dialogue was a little annoying at times. There was one NPC character that always started every sentence off with &quot;In my humble opinion&quot; and that got very annoying at the beginning of the game because I ran into him a lot.  The dialogue was also weak and didn't get the storyline across fast enough.The graphics aren't very good for the PSX. This was made in 2000 and we were looking at games like FFIX and LOD then and these graphcis couldn't compare. They're fuzzy. While they aren't that bad, I wasn't quite used to that.The other major gripe (and the reason I gave it three stars) is the music.  The music is by far some of the worst I've heard in an RPG. Seems kind of stupid to dislike the music huh? In an RPG you have to realize that you may need to endure some music for hours.  The music in this was enough to make my ears explode!The other reason I gave this three stars is because the most important element to me was a little shabby. That's storyline.  There was a story in this game but it was slow and boring to get to.  The story paced so slowly and I couldn't take it!I was a little disappointed in this game but it really wasn't all that bad. But the music and storyline...something I have to deal with throughout the entire game, were overall weak.  So to be truthful this game isn't the most worthwhile in the bunch but for any RPGer its very promising because of gameplay this game is easily a good one to choose.The good+Great gameplay+Good battle system+Character development+Not a bad story although...The bad-Story moves very slowly-Music is annoying!-The graphics aren't the best.Overall the game is a nice treat for an RPGer but its only worth for me to play through once.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not bad but certainly isn't very good.", "unixReviewTime": 1057363200, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2003"}

You have plenty of weapons and different ways to solve puzzles such as using Dan's head, torches etc.The combat is pretty simple with the smashing of X while you can strafe with R1 or charge up your hits with square. While the combat gets very repetitive it's the least of ME2's problems. The main problem comes into the extremely frustrating and almost impossible platforming sections. The developers made the spaces between platforms so far apart that it requires extreme precision. This doesn't help when you have to double tap a direction to make Dan run and when he does jump it's not that far.This snowballs into badly placed checkpoints (actually none at all!) and if you don't have any extra life bottles (which are scarce) you have to start all over again. The only thing that keeps you from tossing the game at the wall are the short levels. Each one can be completed in about twenty minutes or so depending on if you can complete the puzzle/bosses with the little to no hints the game gives you.If you can look past these major faults you will enjoy ME2's funny humor and excellent voice acting (which was rare back then) so pick this up in your bargain bin next time you're out.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A funny romp is hurt by troubled platforming segments", "unixReviewTime": 1332979200, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2012"}

It was a fantastic game and top of the platform genre, rivalled only by Crash Bandicoot and possibly Wild 9. It was set in Medievil times, obviously, and, although a bit easy, was value for money as it is an enjoyable game from start to finish. The only glitches are the already mentioned lifespan of the game and a few camera angles.Fast-forward two years and the sequel is somewhat dissapointing. Gone are the atmospheric, 'MEDIEVIL' levels such as 'The Sleeping Village', 'The Pirate Ship', the time zone one and the one in the castle. Instead we have a museum, an observitory and Kew Gardens. These levels were nowhere near as good as the ones in the previous game, for they had a lot more atmosphere and had a more Medievil style about them. There were still a few glimpses of the levels from the first game, Kensington (The Sleeping Village perhaps?), Cathedral Spires and Wulfrum Hall are the highlights of the game.Apart from the above, there are no major differences. The camera angles are just as good, but can be just as bad. The control of the character is exactly the same and there is little change in the graphics. The major letdown is the length. After the challenge of the first game, this was even easier to complete. If you have the choice of buying a top class platformer then I strongly recomend Medievil 1 or Crash 3 though these can be a little easy. If your looking for a challenging platformer then buy Wild 9.I know I've slated the game quite badly in this review, but it is still a lot better than some games I've played.

I decided to buy the game about a year ago (I was poor, and waiting for the price drop). I had hoped that this could fill the void as I awaited the release of Final Fantasy X on the Playstation 2.Well, FFX has come and went, as have countless other games, and I STILL cannot muster the energy to put the sad, sad \"Legend of Dragoon\" out of its misery. I don't even know where to BEGIN damning this game, so let's begin at the beginning...Firstly, who in the WORLD conceived the lousy, pitiful soundtrack? From the opening title screen on, it seems as if the music was composed by some hair-metal band after a suicide attempt. And the plot? Can't Squaresoft sue? I mean, I have never seen a bigger ripoff of Final Fantasy VII, from the spiky haired lead character to the silver haired foe leading him by the nose across the world! Unfortunately for all, the results are far inferior to the Square offering...Also, who in the world TRANSLATED this thing? (I assume it is translated, I HOPE it is translated, I PRAY it is translated, sigh). Every character needs about a paragraph to say what could be thoroughly explained in a sentence. Does anyone even CARE about these characters? I sure don't...Oh, let's not forget the battle engine. Before every (RANDOM) encounter, the screen melts away like sand, followed by a sweeping camera laying out the poorly drawn field of battle, followed by a shot of the characters, and then one of the monsters. This happens before EVERY battle! I estimate a good ten hours of playtime is wasted just from this...Oh, and the battles? Don't even get me started. I will describe but one of the (uncountably infinite) shortcomings: a character can only cast magic while in the \"dragoon\" state. This makes every battle unbearably long, and expect to be hit with a random encounter every 5 seconds or so...I guess I'm left to ask, \"What was the big deal?\" Personally, I feel sorry for the schmoes who plunked down full price for this stinker (and apparently there were a lot of you; this game is a best-seller!).

There are so many rave reviews for Legend of Dragoon that I am forced to write yet another sobering one so you actually know what you're  buying. And, no, I am not biased toward the Final Fantasy series. In fact,  I've never played a minute of it.Legend of Dragoon is a long, four-CD  role-playing game made by Sony Computer Entertainment. The game is  accompinied with the company motto &quot;created by a team of one hundred  over the course of three years&quot;, probably aimed to impress.Now,  Legend of Dragoon (from now on referred to as LoD) isn't an awful game by  any means. It's actually somewhat innovative. The problem with the game is  that it is horribly restrictive, as if Sony was afraid to innovate too much  and loose the target audience.Take, for example, the turn-based combat  system that various other reviewers tout as the greatest ever. Sony  introduced a minor element of action to each character's turn in combat by  allowing you to increase the number of strikes per attack with a well-timed  press of a button. These combination attacks are called Additions. Each has  its own name, damage multiplier, and the limit to the number of attacks.  Sony went ahead and made it so EACH CHARACTER CAN ONLY PERFORM ONE TYPE OF  ADDITION PER BATTLE, effectively doing away with any strategy you may have  hoped to develop. In fact, these combos are actually standard attacks,  since by failing to perform them all the way through will cause miserably  little damage, in no way enough to kill the bosses. Whether this action  element is good is up to you. I enjoyed the realism a bit, although to pull  off some of the faster, longer, and more complex additions is quite  hard.This restrictiveness extends to other parts of the battle engine as  well: too few magic spells (most of them attack spells in various elemental  flavors) and a laughably small inventory are the major examples.Although  some of you are bound to disagree with me (why else would my reviews  accumulate negative votes?), the music is unimpresive and low on melody.  Likewise, the voice acting (in battle, not in FMV) ranges from uninspired  to ludicrous. Although the voices fit in rather well, the translations are  hideous (Flurry/Ferry of Styx comes in as the most rampant example).The  game's chief downfall is the hideous dialog which spoils an otherwise  promising story. The characters spout off poor humor and awkward jokes at  the most inappropriate moments, while the designated comic relief character  is so amazingly annoying that I had trouble with keeping my Playstation on.  Likewise, the characters are stereotypes: the short-tempered hero, the  valiant knight, the mysterious dark lady, and the damsel in distress are  just a sampling of the playable characters. The characters also seem  utterly incapable of logical thought. At times hey brought me to tears with  their &quot;whatever happens is fine&quot; attitudes. Example (not word for  word): &quot;Whoopie! We're sailing to the place where our chief nemesis  went!&quot; &quot;I wonder why our enemy told us where he was going?&quot;  &quot;Beats the heck out of me!&quot; And so on and so forth to infinity  and beyond.The prerendered backgrounds are absolutely amazing (although  the designers forgot that livelihood depends not only on photorealism but  on movement as well), the very few FMVs being literally fantastic. Sadly,  not too many FMVs ar what you might expect: most are &quot;scroll across  the mural in 2D&quot; type.The in-battle graphics are a step back,  though. To accomodate the constant motion, almost everything looks blocky  and low on polygons, especially the enemies (Crystal Golem and Wounded Bear  being prime examples of low polygon counts). Your characters and the  enemies are so far apart that it's very hard to orient the camer to see  both sides of battle. The bakgrounds are low-detil and look washed-out,  especiualy when compared to the rest of the game. Your enemies include a  variety of rats, moles, bats, kiwi birds, tutles, and such. Somehow I  didn't expect to fight forest animals on my &quot;epic quest&quot;.Sadly  enough, this game is actually up to current standards in gaming. I can only  name a few games that significantly raise the bar (and I won't name them  for fear of angered fans). I can only tell you to give this game a try. If  you are easily entertained by large explosions, sword-swinging characters,  twenty-second-long magic spells, and muddled, simplistic chracter  interaction, by all means, get this game right now.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The masterpiece of mediocrity", "unixReviewTime": 966470400, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2000"}

I picked this as my introduction to the genre as I wanted to play a regular or average JRPG first to establish a good baseline as a comparison to the games I'd play later on.I had a blast playing it.  Over 120 hours (most people will take less time - I'm a grinder) of playing time is a spectacular bargain considering that you'll pay far less than $10 for it.  The melodramatic story was a particular joy.The most annoying part was the addition combat.  Maybe I'm totally inept but I was NEVER able to hit a level 3 combo and usually missed the level 2s.  Since the most powerful combos go up to level 7 that can be a problem.  But you can still win the game without doing well in addition combat - there are artifacts in the game that will allow you to hit the additions all the time.I could go on but it would all be repeating things from other reviews.  The MAIN reason I'm posting this review is to help out the PS2 players who experience lockups or freezes that keep them from completing the game.  I had that problem as well and was able to fix it.First off, I experienced rare random crashes but was always able to restore from the last save and continue the game without that crash repeating.  Save often!There are 3 boss fights that will crash the game if you use Dragoon mode.  At the end of those fights, after the experience points roll up, the game will just freeze.  It will happen EVERY TIME if you use Dragoon mode in these boss fights.  (btw, the game has a LOT of boss fights.  They're very entertaining)The solution to the first 2 fights is NOT to use Dragoon mode.  (At that point in the game your characters are at least as powerful without Dragoon mode anyway.  You just use different tactics to win.)  Those 2 fights are vs. Lenus & Regole at the end of disc 2 and the boss battle at Aglis on disc 4.The 3rd boss fight is the final one against the big bad.  The solution is ... don't worry about it!  Go ahead and use Dragoon mode.  It doesn't matter if the game locks up because the game's over after you win anyway!  You still get to see the closing credits and what happens to each character and so on.  It might be possible to win the last battle without Dragoon mode but that fight is SUCH a struggle (it took me over 45 minutes to win on the first attempt) that I wasn't interested in trying it again without using Dragoon mode.Summing up.

On  it's own, it is a fun, satisfying, and worthwile game. But it definitely doesn't hold a candle to the FF games.Though the battle system is familiar to any RPG fan, it is the graphics that really give this game the edge. Boasting &quot;3 years in the making, with a design team of over 100&quot;, their efforts were well spent. The battles are challenging enough, while the enemies are challenging and diverse. In terms of control, it is similar to most of the FF games, so it doesn't take long to master battles and manouvering. As the game progresses, the characters get stronger, allowing them to inflict even more damage. Overall, this is a challenging and rewarding game.But sadly, this game is tainted by a few minor flaws. The cliched &quot;Unlock the mysteries of the past&quot; plot is nothing we haven't seen before, add to this the paper thin characters that we couldn't care less about.  There are some technical flaws that need addressing. First, the number is items that can be carried. Why is it that you can carry 256 &quot;Armed&quot; items (weapons and armor) but you can only cary 32 standard items (like healing potions and cure potions, which is what you most often need)? Another flaw is that, unlike the free roaming of FF games, you are confined to the dotted lines on the world map. So there is little room for exploration. One thing that particularly bugged me about this game is that the plot is so linear, meaning that the side quests that we enjoyed with Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 3 are not prevelant here.But these are minor flaws, considering that the point of the game is to fight until the end to save innocent people from bloodshed.

Its not because it was difficult. I stopped playing out of my own will because ths was, simply put, the most generic, boring RPG I have ever laid my eyes upon.What would have become a great game changed into a catastrophic failure. First off, these characters looked like they were taken from FFVII, given a different haricut, and stripped of all their personality. Dart looks a lot like Cloud. Shawna looks a lot like Tifa. See some sort of resemblance here? Now if only the in-game 3D models moved and looked as good as Square's offerings. The characters lack any real depth of color, and the animation is choppy. The music lacks any power at all; this was also the first game I turned the sound off for. The songs were too repetitive and the voice-overs were pathetic.Now my main gripe: The plot. What kind of half-assed shit is this? As one person put it, &quot;I've seen a Power Rangers episode with a better storyline.&quot; The plot does nothing to keep you in its grasps to make the game at leats somewhat attractive to its players. The first plot twist will occur at the end of the second disc. That's about 20-25 hours away for things to get interesting. That would be a little forgiveable if only the characters weren't so damn boring. Each character sounds the same, they lack diversity, with one exception: the really big guy that sounds like a retard (I can't remember his name at the moment).I will, however, give credit where credit is due: This game, while it has lackluster character models, also features some of the finest looking FMVs and backgrounds to ever grace the Playstation. If you're a gamer that enjoys great eye candy most of all, this is the game for you. If you enjoy strong plots, go with Xenogears (if you can find it) or Chrono Cross.

A quick explanation: the additions are combos that require precision tapping of the X buton, or O button when an enemy counters you (this can get extremely hard, as they'll likely counter during the hardest part of the combo). Each addition is different, the paces get harder as you go, but my god it's rewarding to see a completed addition and watch the enemy fry. I've seen many games that incorporate combos, but never an RPG that incorporates them so effectively.Other pros include the animation sequences (though they sometimes appear in the most unlikely and random spots in the game, whereas others that should have animation do not), the voices/sounds, the looong storyline (lots of twists), and of course the Dragoon transformations. Cons include the poor world map (you have to move in select lines, you do not have free roaming like FF games), the cheesiness (oh yeah, on a scale of 1-10 this game ranks an 8 in cheesiness, and no we're not talking about cheddar), and the other bits I added earlier.Overall a fine game, a bit in the shadow of other games that came out near this one's release (such as FF9, which lacks in storyline but is far superior in graphics/animation), but it has enough unique qualities to stand alone, and it really boils down to the combat sequences with the help of additions and Dragoon transformations.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It's all about the additions baby", "unixReviewTime": 1090454400, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2004"}

This is innovative partly because it does require constant concentration and precise timing to execute.  Basically, additions allow your characters to increase the damage caused by their physical attacks.  You have to push the controller buttons at the precise moment in order to execute these additions.  And, do not expect to master all of the additions for any of the characters.  The most powerful additions require too many timed button presses to execute reliably.The story is fairly standard RPG material.  You play as the main character, Dart.  Dart is on a journey to avenge the destruction of his village and the death of his parents.  Along the way, he meets up with some very eccentric adventurers who follow him on his quests for their own personal reasons.  What starts out as a journey for revenge turns out to be something more significant.  As the story unfolds, it turns out that what people have believed for 10,000 years may not be the actual truth.  What God had in mind for humans may not be in our best interest.  Dart and company travel across three nations to try and unravel the mystery.This game is a very good alternative to the Final Fantasy series for those who love to hack, slash, bash, and cast spells.  The battle system here is much better than Final Fantasy X's.  This is perhaps the most sophisticated RPG for the original playstation.  Playing the game in a PS2 supposedly gives the graphics a boost, but I have not had a chance to compare them side by side.  I can say that on a PS2, the graphics are very good.

These warriors obtain these gems that allow them to transform into armored warriors and slightly change the course of battle.The game features some nice cutscenes, nice graphics, SOME interesting characters, and an interesting plot only brought down by some uninspired or drab locales, a somewhat predictable or cliched set of events, and a few annoying voice overs.Graphics- 7/10Prerendered backgrounds that are quite lovely. Beautiful and action packed FMV sequences that are definitely worth watching. Transformations that are eye catching. Some of the character models are a little blocky; however, they animate quite well in and out of battle. They animate with such fluidity fit the game quite well.Sound- 7/10The music wasn't exactly epic, but it worked. Some of the music was a little monotonous; but it was suiting.Sound effects were quite pleasant. Earlier in the game, you could hear the rushing of the water. Every action had a suiting sound effect.The voices were both good and bad. The voices of the characters fit them perfectly, but some of the voice acting didn't quite fit with some of the actions of some of the characters; they were good for the most part though.Story- 8/10The story was quite enjoyable and unique. The story didn't drag too much and kept its pace. The one thing I can say is that the story itself didn't deviate too much...or at least the events that occurred during the story. Everything just falls into place nicely. The fact that the game revolved around warriors able to harness the power of \"dragoon armor\" was pretty cool.Gameplay- 7/10The gameplay is typical RPG fare. It seems the two ways to determine gameplay lies within how exploration takes place and how battles are played. Exploration takes place as most of the RPGs do; the battle is turn-based. Fighters can time their attacks (using X) to do a combo attack that can take more damage than just initiating an attack.You can also transform into dragoons during battle which actually add to the strategy of battles. There is a basic attack that requires you to time your button presses which (like the character chain/combo attacks) can deal more damage the more times you press the attack button at the right time.I recommend this game to anyone who's looking to play an RPG that is a little different in terms of characters and abilities. The Sailor Moon-esque element this game has definitely makes it different from a lot of the other RPGs out there.

The storyline, while not completely original, was very well written; the sound was great; and the graphics were amazing.  The backgrounds were some of the most detailed I've seen.  Also, the combat system was nice in that it did something new that went beyond a mere push of a button for an attack.The combo system used in this game takes timing into account during battles.  Timing button pushes to the display onscreen results in more hits and additional combos the more they are used.  The Dragoon aspect of the game was very interesting as well, but it seemed underutilized.  That is probably my only complaint about the game.  The battles were such that you really only used the Dragoon agains bosses because you'd want to keep using combos in regular attacks to increase your power.  That's only a minor complaint though.The sound was great.  It was very full and escaped the high, whiny music often found in RPG titles.  The story, while as I said not original, is very well done.  Characters are very well developed and interaction is good.  This adds to replay value because you can't really use all of the characters throughout the game, but need to focus on one group.  There are enough characters to choose from that in replaying the game you can use all different characters.This is a very solid game.  Not as good as Final Fantasy VII (but I doubt any game will be), but much better than Final Fantasy VIII.  The combo system is a nice addition.

This game has several failings that cannot be ignored, but if you give it a chance, you may still garner some enjoyment out of this average RPG.  On to the review!Graphics (8/10): Not the greatest, but not too irritating.  This, of course, is a matter of opinion, but the graphics did not seem too bothersome at all.Music (6/10): Well, the music ranges from not so good to decent.  There's really nothing about the music that would make me want to buy the soundtrack.  The songs are all rather bland and unmemorable, while not being terrible enough to make your ears bleed or anything.  The voice-acting, which is limited, is kind of laughable.  Overall, the bland music and not-so-good voice acting brings down the score in this section.Characters (5/10): The characters really aren't well-developed.  They either have stereotypical personalities or are just plain uninteresting.  Sometimes their actions were not convincing at all.  For example, one person is traveling with the party to find his daughter who ran away.  He then goes on and on about not knowing why she left when you clearly find out in a flashback that he criticized her and slapped her for something she wasn't really at fault for.  Hmmm...I wonder why she ran away?  And then, after hearing this story, the rest of the party sides with him and does not point out the obvious reason she ran away.  Another example of awkward character development is the romance between Dart and Shana. Yes, she's naive and soft-spoken and he's the big hero and they fall in love.  Yes, we've all seen this before.  That's not even my complaint.  The romance between them was badly handled by the game developers.  It seems as though Shana is the only one in love with Dart; he sees her more as a little sister.  This creates some awkward moments between them.  I think the main romantic scene of the game is very awkward.  Instead of Dart and Shana voluntarily getting together, the rest of the party members sort of connive to force them together at a party.  Then, out on a balcony, every time the scene between them becomes serious and they are about to kiss, some random NPC shows up and ruins the moment.  I find this odd attempt at humor to be ill-placed and intrusive.  I never really got the impression that Dart and Shana loved each other, instead I felt that the rest of the party loved the idea of getting them together.  Rose is the only character who seems interesting and has some back story. Overall, the game is riddled with character interactions like those above, this really makes it difficult to care about these characters (other than Rose!).Story (5/10): Once again, \"stereotypical\" is the word of the day.  Guess who's father may be a villian?  No really, guess!  Seriously, the rest of the story feels like one disjointed event after another.  I never felt a sense of continuity with the story, and the final villian seems to come from nowhere.  I never saw it coming, IN A BAD WAY! I mean, the game really could have used some foreshadowing or building up for the final villian.  All that aside, the game's story does have some high points, the \"mythological\" feel of the game is interesting, and although I can't remember for the life of me what all actually happened during the story, I had fun while playing through it.Battle System (7/10): Well, it's turn based. Not much to say there.  My only real complaint was with the Additions.  While I mostly liked the originality of this element, it was somewhat irritating at times.  The goal is to hit the X button at just the right time to execute your attack.  If you miss even one in the string, your attack does pitiful damage.  As it can be quite difficult to get all of them in a longer string, I was often forced to use weaker Additions instead of the stronger, (and longer) ones.  Aside from that aspect, the Dragoon system was fun.  I only wish there were some way to revert out of Dragoon mode, and also to cast magic outside of Dragoon mode.  Despite my complaints, I found most of the battle system to be not too annoying.Gameplay (6/10): Wow. There's alot of backtracking.  This can get tedious; I think I went through some place three times.  Another issue I have with gameplay is that in disc 2, the game forces you to insert disc 1 again to get into some of the towns.  What nonsense is this?!  I don't think I've ever played another RPG that had this problem.  This is what lowers the score most for this section.  Other than the things listed above, I don't have any other issues with gameplay.Overall (6/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score.  While Legend of Dragoon does not measure up to so many other RPGs out there, oddly I still enjoyed it.  This is certainly not the worst RPG out there, it's just not the best either.  Since it's so inexpensive now (at the time of writing this; July 2008), it wouldn't hurt to pick this game up and give it a chance.  You may at least get some amusement out of laughing at the bad dialogue.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Rather Muddled RPG, But Still Capable of Delivering Some Enjoyment", "unixReviewTime": 1215648000, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2008"}
{"reviewerID": "A3AQJOBOI60CVJ", "asin": "B00004S9AF", "reviewerName": "Felllix", "helpful": [1, 6], "reviewText": "What a generic title. Given the game, that's par for the course. The Legend of Dragoon is certainly the most generic game I've played on the Playstation. It's sort of sad, in many ways, that it was released by SCEA only months before Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX, and over a year after Final Fantasy VIII.What's generic about it? Damn near everything. The main character is a spiky-haired blonde dude whose small village is destroyed by an evil empire, and who is designated the \"chosen one\" by a pendant, previously possessed by a mysterious stranger. Can you even name how many other games that borrows from? Do numbers go that high? And I forgot to mention, his representative color is red. Of course, the empire is still on the prowl, and Dart has to chase them with a diverse group of heroes.And that's not even touching the translation- The Legend of Dragoon boasts some truly embarrassing translation errors. Square learned this lesson after Final Fantasy VII, which took a lot of flack for its stereotypes and writing, but that game had an interesting setting and strong enough characters to make up for it. The Legend of Dragoon wasn't just several years behind, it was at least two games behind by PS1 jRPG standards.While the story is generic and perfunctory, it's not really the problem. Let's talk about the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's basis for combat is a series of timed button presses known as \"additions.\" When one chooses the attack option, a reticle focuses in on the enemy, and a button must be pressed to time with the animation. While this basic idea has been done in other games, like Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy VIII, and the Mario and Luigi series, The Legend of Dragoon makes it the core of combat, and that's a fatal error. While timed button presses were integral to the games I mentioned, the important thing is that they didn't slow down the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's combat forces you to do this chain of animations every time you click attack, and when you miss, you get to see your character freeze in place as a number appears only once in front of the enemy. Random encounters, which are the majority of the game in RPGs, take forever and feel clunky. The Dragoon transformations- a flashy sequence comparable to Power Rangers- are also longer than necessary and the Dragoon attacks do little to change my complaints about the rest of the game.The look of the game is very generic as well. While the pre-rendered backgrounds of the game look fine, the character models outside of combat are simplistic and poorly animated. The in-combat look is marginally better, and while the Dragoon transformations look good, the default character models aren't very detailed, and neither are the enemies. The combat environments look especially poor- many of the floors and walls are a single polygon with a blocky texture applied to it.As far as I'm concerned, the great-looking cinematics don't count when we're talking about graphics, though it is worth noting that the ones in The Legend of Dragoon look great. But you might as well jump on youtube and watch all of them instead of playing the game, or rent Advent Children or The Spirits Within, or Shrek for that matter, if that's all you care about. The art design of the game doesn't lend itself to Playstation's technology.I hesitate to speculate on matters like this, but The Legend of Dragoon strikes me as an attempt by Sony to cash in after the success of Final Fantasy VII. The game looks an awful lot like that game, with a fantasy setting substituted for a steam/cyberpunk one. I wouldn't call that an improvement.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Just not very good.", "unixReviewTime": 1297728000, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2011"}

Sony unfortunately brought that upon themselves with the main character looking similar to Cloud and Lloyd having silver hair like Sephiroth. Despite all that Sony put out an excellent game that noone should miss.Story: The story starts 10,000 years before Dart and company and brings along many twists and takes you along an epic journey. There are evil emperors and dragons to fight and control as you progress throughout the game. Again, the story is as old and original as you can get, boy likes girl, girl gets kidnapped, boy saves girl and world. Again remember its not the story itself but how the story is told that makes it great. There is a lot more to the story with 9 different playable characters each bringing their own story into the mix to help complicate the ultimate goal.Graphics: This game is visually stunning from the cg clips that help drive the story along to the random battles. 3-D battles with stunning visual armor and Dragoon transformations are done really well. Dragons look rather funny, but everyone has there own take on how dragons should look, I wasn't to fond of most of them as some didn't look like dragons to me. I still don't understand why games like this and final fantasy don't have their characters armor change when you go into fight modes. They could take some notes from the makers of Legend of Legaia.Combat System: I did like the \"addition\" system but an option to just hit a button and go through some random battles would've been nice. Dragoon transformation was awesome and unfortunately can be a rather long and annoying process making some boss battles last over 30 min's and thats with the shorter transformations. Magic usage was dissapointing as you can only use them while in Dragoon form and you only get 4 spells per character except Kongol who only gets 3. The spells and dragon summons are nicely done and Rose has a well....its different thats for sure. It would have been nice to change out Dart in the party so you could use different character combinations. For the most part its nicely done and an enjoyment to use.Characters: Dart is your main character who is afraid to admit his emotions to Shana. Shana is your heroine who gets kind of annoying with self confidence issues but is easily overlooked. Rose is your quiet and mysterious character who is probably the most loved character in the game. Lavitz becomes Darts best friend in the game and is a loyal knight to the King. Albert is the King in the country you live in and is a key part in the beginning of the story. Haschel is an old martial arts and tries to be the comedic guy in the party. Kongol is your typical \"dumb\" strong guy and is used in most of your battles. Meru is your fun loving annoying character who has a lot of energy. Lastly there is Miranda who I thought was only a space filler and brings nothing to the table storywise or in fights.Music: I liked all the music from the battle music to the love story music and all. The diologue was about average for rpg's but with everything going the way it was going at the time they needed to bring a more realistic and mature dialogue to the table.The game is four-discs long and you can put in 65+ hours easily. The bad diologue is a turn-off for a lot of most gamers but you can easily figure out what is being said. The linear exploration of the world map wasn't great but did keep you progressing in the story and kept things moving along. Overall the cons in the game are easily over looked and forgotten about.

By performing additions, you level them up and gain bonuses. These additions each need to be used a rather large number of times, forcing you to spend large amounts of time fighting just for the sake of using the additions. And considering how each of your characters has their own additions to master, it can take a very long time to master them all.

I have to laugh when it took them three years to cook up this title that can't even dent the Final Fantasy fanchise.I don't think the Final Fantasy series is the greatest thing since sliced bread (I actually like the Wild Arms series the most), but the only thing Legend of Dragoon really had going for it was its graphics, which I will admit where pretty sweet at the time.Outside the graphical engine, Legend of Dragoon is second rate RPG in every category. Lame enemies, lackluster story, generic locations, and some of the worst music to ever accompany an PSX RPG ever (it's really that bad). Fights are also annoying due to the so-called \"Additions\" system which has you doing timed hits all day (yeah, that's what I call fun when I have to hit a button 8 times in a row at just the correct moment just to attack).Other problems also arise, such as the fact no one can use magic outside of their dragoon transformations, meaning their is really no way to heal your characters except for items (which you become way too dependent on in this game, and can only carry so many). Outside the dragoon tranformations the battle system is very weak.Play Legend of Dragoon only after you have destroyed every other PSX PRG.

Where to begin? First let me say that I'm not an idiot who carelessly gives out perfect scores. But this game is just so good, it deserves it.Combat:This is a turn-based game with an innovative combat system. You can have 3 members in your party. When it's your turn, you attack, defend, use items, or transform into Dragoons (more on this later). The attack system is really the innovative part. You time input of the X button as rotating squares align with the center square on screen. If the timing isn't perfect, your combo stops. You keep up the perfect timing until your combo is finished. With every 20 perfect combo you pull off-called \"additions\"-your addition gets stronger. The perfect timing sounds hard, but it's really not. It just takes a little practice, and seeing your addition play out on screen is always fun. There are anywhere from 3 to 7 additions for each character, and you switch out additions whenever you feel like it. There's plenty to master here with the number of playable characters. You later gain the ability to transform into a Dragoon, a flying warrior capable of performing magical attacks. In this state your attack and defense power increase, and you can level up your Dragoon Level in addition to regular level. You have a threat indicator above you that shows when you'll engage in battle. It increases in threat level as you move around and the screen fades to battle. Some might find this annoying, but I liked having the chance to get stronger.Format:You play from a sort of backed-away view. It's third person, but not zoomed in like with Uncharted or Dead Space. You travel from area to area via the world map. Once you know what your objective is, you just go to the right area and go from there.Environments:You'll encounter everything under the sun: from underwater settings to expansive deserts. And every place is extremely diverse with its own interactions. In a dragon's lair, you'll climb spiderweb-like strings. On a snowy mountain, you'll slide down slopes. In the desert, you'll get sucked into sand-whirlpools. Then there's of course the cities to visit. Each city has its own feel; you can enter shops, houses, castles, hotels-you name it. The developers were really imaginative with everything.Graphics:Outdated by today's standards, but impressive for its time. You can still make out figures, so it's not too bad. Personally, though, I don't play games for their graphics.Story:Very well written. It starts off as a simple rescue-the-damsel-in-distress but evolves into so much more, and I really can't give away too much plot detail. Just know that there are a couple plot twists and that along the way you'll meet new party members that you'll come to know and love. This is one heck of a 4-disc story.Quests:There's plenty of things to do to occupy your time. Aside from the main quest, there's a few side quests that include freeing souls, battling an evil wizard, hunting a wolf, and collecting Stardust for items. Then there's even special enemies that drop special items. These are unusual foes you'll encounter on the world map that involve using a different battle strategy.Gripes:As I've said, the graphics aren't the best, but put yourself in the year 2000 and they're mind-blowing. Another minor thing is that the voice acting is absolutely dreadful. But take heart, there are maybe 3 scenes in the ENTIRE game that use voice acting.Overall:An incredibly awesome experience. It spans the length of 4 discs, is immensely fun to play, and is more than worth the $6 it costs on PSN.

This game does have a very good story with twist of plots. The in game movies are really good and with good sound effects and voice over. The environments in the game are also very well done and detailed made, which is a huge credit for the game. This game also adopt both types of battle encounters - random and touch base, which feels like utilising both ways to attract gamers to play it. The battle system is very Final Fantasy indeed. Turn based menu with different commands. The biggest feature is the Addition which requires skillful timing to get the biggest damage on the enemies. Nonetheless, it will be frustrating if you are in a boss fight and just missed one button that your can't finish the addition. The upside is you can purchase item (but at high cost) to ask the computer to finish the additions perfectly for you. Also the enemies will counter attack you if additions are done manually, which adds the difficult in physical attacks. Magic attacks are limited to using magical items, which lacks flexibility. At the same time, you can only hold 32 items at one time further limits your flexibility as some useful items are reuseable and must be kept to get your through the games; that leaves limited space for magical items considering you will need to use a lot of healing items if you characters levels are not high enough. The most annoying part of the game is the SNAIL PACE levelling up. Since all the experience points are shared by all members in the battle, this largely reduces the points each character can get in a single battle. Considering at a certain level, you need more than 10 thousand points to level up and every battle just earns you 200 points! This might be the reason that many people just finish the game with great effort at level 35-50 ....The highest level you can get for your characters is 60 but it will take you more than 400 hours to get most of your characters to that level. After level 60, the character will continue to receive experience points but without levelling up ...Another annoying part is sometimes the character selection screen just pop up without a reason and you will find that your original party was moved and substitute by other characters, which will then require you to choose again without a reason. Also good items are very difficult to find and some of them cost you a huge fortune to get. The development of the characters are also not as flexible as those in Final Fantasy for you can only equip them with certain stuff and some of those stuff are really useless.

It has a small monorcome LCD screen, A and B buttons, as well as sleep and mode buttons.It works by being inserted upside down in the DC controller, very similar to the expansion solts on the Xbox and N64 contollers. You will notice there is a square opening in the contoller to see the screen during gameplay. It serves as a secondary screen, almost like the GBA did for the GCN. The screen works for various games in different ways. In NFL 2K1 you can use it to call plays so your oponent can't see what you're about to do, in Resident Evil it will display your heath meter without going to the status screen.You can also use the VMU outside of the controller. They can be used for mini games in various titles, and in Marvel vs. Capcom 2 you can trade characters if you link 2 of them together. They do reqire 2 watch batteries to run if not powered by the system. I'm told they don't last very long, but it does have a sleep function to help with that. I've never had a VMU with a good battery, so I can't say. You can tell if the batteries are dead if they beep when the system boots up.It has a slot on the bottom for a lanyard of sorts, or to be worn around the neck. I suppose if the DC had ever taken off it would be a cool addition, as it stands most kids probably don't even know anything about it.Finally it's primary function is a memory card. As such it does what it's supposed to do, saving and transferring data is a no brainer from the dreamcast's dasboard. There are the occasional files that cant be transfered (they have a red box instead of black around the icon in the dashboard) the problem can be alevited by booting the data up with one VMU, changing it out with another and saving again. Not the most elegant solution but it works because they can be hot swapped any time you aren't saving (otherwise the file will be corrupted). It comes with 200 blocks (128 kb) of flash memory. I got to be honest, it's not a whole lot, so I suggest getting 2 of them. If you need more memory than that a good option is the 4 way memory card which has 800 blocks of memory. It lacks the other functionality mentioned above including the screen but it does offer more memory. I reccomend against getting 3rd party, it doesnt pay to take the chance of losing your hard earned data to save a few bucks. Especially now that they are dirt cheap. The screens can be customized on the dashboard and come in a variety of colors to differentiate them apart.If you have a Dreamcast this should something you already own, if you're buying one, this should go along with you're purchase.

The VMU can hold up to 200 blocks of memory, and while this may seem like a lot, most of Sega's 2K2 sports titles take just about 200 blocks of memory just to save options let alone a team season. Not to mention that after a while the battery life of the VMU LCD screen will die, and that happens quicker than expected, but the LCD screen isn't necessarily needed if your just using the VMU as a memory card and nothing more.

{"reviewerID": "A3MU9G6YWKTGTA", "asin": "B00004SDGB", "reviewerName": "Cary L. Brown", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "First off...  any of Simon and Schuster's Trek games are virtually impossible to get to run on a modern system without extensive effort and technical know-how, and this is no exception.There are multiple S&S; software items out there.  The \"Interactive Technical Manual,\" the \"Captain's Chair,\" the \"Omnipedia\" (and \"Omnipedia Update\"), the \"Interactive Encyclopedia, the \"Star Trek - Borg\" and \"Star Trek - Klingon\" interactive movies, the \"Starship Creator\" programs, and \"Deep Space 9 - Dominion Wars\" (the only conventional \"game\" in the bunch).ALL, except Dominion Wars, use Quicktime (and Macromedia Director) as their media playback tools.  It's entirely possible to get the \"Director\" program to run on any 32-bit computer (but don't bother on a 64-bit version except in a virtual machine).  And it's entirely possible to have the version(s) of Quicktime these various programs require installed, provided you don't have LATER versions of Quicktime installed, again, on a 32-bit machine, but not on a 64-bit one (except if using a VM).The biggest problems ultimately come from the use of Director (as the playback framework), which used to be owned by Macromedia but is now owned by Adobe (who have it available for download, but haven't touched it in years), and from Quicktime.Quicktime is HORRIBLE...  because Apple (the maker of Quicktime) released later version of the \"same software\" which have NOTHING to do with the earlier versions whatsoever, and are not compatible.  Oh, and Apple likes to install \"extras\" which do fun things to your computer...  like a recent \"iTunes\" update which caused CD/DVD drives on tens of thousands of user's computers to \"disappear\" from Windows Explorer).  Apple, frankly, is responsible for more \"bad things\" happening to my Windows based computer than anything else I've ever encountered.  And I LIKE competition.  I just dislike \"sabotage.\"In my case, I have abandoned all hope of getting any of them to run properly in windows.  But I have had good luck installing and running them using \"Microsoft Virtual PC 2007\" with an installation of Windows 98SE running inside of that virtual machine, running on a Windows XP \"real\" machine.  I see no reason that this would not work just fine in the virtual machine in Windows 7, for that matter...  but you NEED to be able to install Windows 9x into a virtual machine, it seems, so if you don't still have an old copy of the installer disk for one of the Win9x operating systems, you're likely out of luck.So, the ONLY way I'll install Apple software (old or new) is in a virtual machine.  That way it can't break my main installation again (as has happened more than once).  Fortunately, in the case of the Simon and Schuster applications (except for \"Dominion Wars\") this works out perfectly well!So...  now that you know how to make it run, let's talk about what it actually is.This is NOT an \"action game,\" nor is it a \"tactical simulation.\"  And it's not really a \"technical reference\" either.  It tries to be a hybrid of all three.  But it doesn't do any of them very well.Basically...  you start off by creating a \"user account\" within the game.  This is not a bad approach, as you can create as many \"users\" as you wish.  That would be great if there were several people in your home all wanting to play this, or if you wanted to create multiple independent game sessions.  Each users is an \"Admiral,\" and the concept is that you're in charge of a fleet.You have a limited amount of \"Federation Credits\" which you can use to buy and outfit ships in your fleet.  You earn more credits by completing missions.  So far, so good... right?You pick a ship \"class,\" and then get to pick and choose from some alternative part appearances, making your ship look unique.  You get to pick a name (and a registration number) for your ship.  And there is a small 3D interface within the game which allows you to see a low-polygon-count version of the ship you've assembled.  This is the ONLY \"3D\" element of the entire game, though, and it doesn't really add much \"coolness factor\" to the game, really.  Okay, you also get to see the same 3D low-poly-count model when you log out of the game.)They did provide an option to export your custom ship configuration to the only REAL \"game\" S&S; put out, Dominion Wars, with the \"Warp 2\" version of this program.  So, that's of some minor interest.You then start choosing systems (which cost credits) for your ship.  You get a fair amount of potential tweaking for any ship, and there's a fair amount of technical-manual-type information about each system you're choosing to install.  Eventually, you'll want to upgrade every ship in your fleet to the max settings, though...  initially, it's just a matter of determining what to buy first.You also get to pick a crew (or rather, key crewmembers... you don't pick the entire crew!).  These are MOSTLY characters from on-screen Trek.  It's possible to create your own characters, though not from within the application, and there used to be some \"extra downloadable crew\" (I got those for Peter David's \"New Frontier\" novels, for example).  Again, the crew costs money, but you'll eventually want to \"upgrade\" to the best available for each ship, so it's really a matter of choosing what to upgrade first.Once you have a ship that you think is suitable, you choose a mission to send the ship on.  Success in a mission earns you more credits.The problem is that the gameplay at this point cannot really be called \"gameplay\" at all.  Rather, you have a small window which is essentially a \"map\" and a scrolling \"communications message list.\"  And you just sit there and watch things unfold.  If you set the speed to be higher, this can happen quickly, but if you're letting it go in \"real time,\" get a book to read between messages and events.You don't get to watch the ship doing things in real 3D.  You don't HEAR the comm chatter.  You don't have any real control over what's happening at this point.  You just... sit, watch, and wait.Okay, there's some interest in discovering if you have come up with the best configuration for your ship(s) for a particular mission...  but this is about the most tedious way of doing that I could imagine.The sad thing is, if someone were to try to remake this today, and use voice actors, modern graphical presentation (including 3D inside and outside the ship you're \"watching\") and so forth, it might actually make for a reasonably fun game.  The CONCEPT isn't terrible, but the execution is.I tried to like it... I really did.  The idea had some great potential.  But the execution is, frankly, only suitable for aiding in combating insomnia.Out of all of the S&S; programs (and I purchased them all), the \"Starship Creator\" games are the only ones I have no interest in getting running again.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "A program which is not sure what it's supposed to be...", "unixReviewTime": 1320624000, "reviewTime": "11 7, 2011"}

I recently bought Star Trek Starship Creator Deluxe which was made a year before this Warp 2 sequel.Starship Creator Deluxe has much more ship constructions to chose from than the new Warp 2 has to offer. In Warp 2 you only get Akira, Soveriegn, Intrepid, Constitution, Defiant, Galaxy, and Klingon B'rel Class Ships to construct.

Warp 2 has less ships and the missions are pretty boring. You could sleep through it and the mission would still be successful. The computer plays the missions out without any real play control from the player. You can however design that dream starship you always wanted to create. If you really want to buy a Starship Creator, I would recommend buying the Star Trek Starship Creator Deluxe which allows the player to create 10 federation ships whereas Starship Creator Warp 2 allows only 6 federation ships and the additional one Klingon B'rel. On a plus side, Warp 2 allows the player to export their designed ships of Akira, Galaxy, and Defiant into Star Trek DS9 Dominon Wars multiplayer mode for gameplay online. However the Galaxy class starships that are exported into the Dominon Wars Game turns out to be invisible (A really big bug/glitch!!!)

Those who are used to the Final Fantasy series by Square will probably be  disappointed by this game because, quite simply - they are of different  genres.  FF is a pure, solid, RPG game without a trace element of Action,  Adventure, or Puzzle.  Vagrant Story, on the other hand, is a combination  of all 4 above genres - and the result is not only fun and entertaining,  but exciting as well.Breakdown-Graphics - Absolutely beautiful  detail, high polygonal characters with lush backgrounds and well-designed  dungeons.  It's good to see that Square does really good work with graphics  even without touching CGI FMV.  Lots of little graphical tweaks (like  accurate shadows, detailed faces) make this game beautiful to watch.  Best  of all, all of the cut scenes are presented using in-game graphics, with  almost cinematic camera shots and techniques - it feels like you're  watching a movie.Music/Sound - Great for atmospherics, but nothing too  memorable for me other than the intro music (played alongside the only FMV  sequence in the entire game).  This is probably the poorest section of the  game, especially given Square's reputation for hiring composers such as  Nobuo Uematsu to do their wonderful orchestrated music.Storyline - Two  thumbs up, the story progresses at a nice, even pace and there aren't any  ridiculous twists and turns in the plotline that make it sound forced.  The  ending is one hell of a clincher...and definitely some of the clearer work  that Square has done recently.Characters - Well developed, etc. etc.  I  like the characters.  We get to know them relatively well, and any  information that we don't receive isn't very important to begin  with.System - This is where the game shines.  The Parasite Eve style  battle system, offence/defence chain abilities, and workshop ideas are all  awesome.  Plus, for the hardcore gamer, technicalities such as weapon  vulnerability, elemental affinity, and monster type all play a role in  effecting the damage you do.It's a great game.  Buy it.

Famitsu has only given like 5 games a perfect score... this being one of them.The characters, design, music, story, atmosphere, and presentation are all top notch and beautiful. The story is sursprisingly mature and the characters are all memorable, especially that mystery man Sydney.So if all of those things are so good and put together, why did this game 'ultimately' fail when it was released? Because of its gameplay.The gameplay 'could have' been fun and classic but the makers decided to bog it down with a tremendously confusing, tedious, and unintuitive menu and weapon system.The base of this game, its weapon system, is beyond complicated. Each weapon can be either piercing, blunt, or edged like a edged sword or a blunt hammer. Then each weapon has about 20 'affinities' such as light, water, physical, undead, etc. Then throw in the fact that each weapon must be made from seperate parts such as a blade, a grip or hilt, plus 1-3 gems. Lost yet? You should be.But thats not all. Each weapon has damage points, kind of like health for weapons, and phantom points which inscrease special attacks. Throw in the fact that the longer you fight the more tired or excited your character gets, which leads you to miss more often and take more damage as the battle goes on.This game does have an awesome quick menu that can be used with the L2 button. This menu lets you do anything from find items to use magic with one push of a button. However, for some reason there is no weapon quick menu in a game almost totally based around your weapons! To change weapons, and you will often, you have to make about 5 clicks through slow menus which can take anywhere from 10 secs to a minute.This games difficult learning curve has turned away so many players without the patience to learn this games ridiculous systems.

Though we have moved on to the next generation of videogaming, it is hard to not go back to this game. The story is deep, the game mechanics are genius and the graphics out do all other psx games out there.This game differs from your standard rpg in sense of how the game is played. There is no leveling up, no towns to visit, or world map to explore. Also the fighting system allows you to have total control. Knowing your opponent is key to beating them. The enemy is divided into classes and you must fight according to their strengths and weaknesses. For ex. if your opponent is a dragon you will have to beat through their tough scales or find a way around them and find a weak point. The enemies aren't your average cannon fodder either. They hit and run, cast spells and play keep away. They will draw into a corner and gang up on you or get you in the open area for an ambush.With enemies that actually use brains and brawn you have to be prepared. This is where the game shines. The weapon and attack system. You start with your basic weapons and armor. As you progress you pick up better stuff and eventually be able to make new weapons and armor. Combining your old stuff you can literally make a new item. I've spent hours combining weapons and armor. Realistically as you use weapons and as your armor takes damage it loses its' strength. At the shops you can also make repairs to your inventory. The battle sysstem is tedious but fun once you get the hang of it. You draw your weapon and a sphere surrounds you. Depending on distance and SIZE of enemies and the range of your weapon you can target body parts. Taking out legs can slow and in some cases immobilize the enemy. Warning this does work both ways so protect yourself. You can cast spells on the fly by use of a quick pop up menu activated by pressing a few buttons. Also as you defeat more enemies you gain break arts, attack and defensive draws that will keep you alive in close battles.My only complaint is that this game is not for everyone. Many will get bored with the slow beginning or find the weapon system to complex to get involved. Most of all that there is no voice acting. I personally favor the text reading but most will find that outdated. In any case this game is hard to fault once you really get involved and is hard to put down. It never got the publicity it deserved, so few will tell you that they have heard of the game. But do not let that discourage you by any means. If you can find a copy get it.

And like Tactics and many of  Square's other games, Vagrant Story shines with a great story and superb  gameplay.Before I get started in bringing out this game's high points,  let me bring to light its aspects that some players might view as  shortcomings.  First, know that this game is complete dungeon-crawling with  no towns to purchase equipment from and no people to converse freely with.  But unlike some games of this type, where the only real fun thing to do is  to find a rare item or encounter a boss, I found Vagrant Story's 3-D  landscapes fun to explore, and the battle system makes any enemy encounter  fun and worthwhile.  Also, to help break the monotony, there is the  occasional challenging block puzzle to solve, in which a player moves  various blocks in order to reach a certain door or treasure chest, and the  cinematic cutscenes that advance the story provide entertaining  intermissions.  Another thing to know is that it will take a few hours to  get into this game, the reason being that until you learn &quot;Chain  Abilities,&quot; the battles seem awkward and tedious.Speaking of  battles, Vagrant Story features a fun, yet in-depth battle system.  To  start, each enemy has an enemy class.  They can be beast, human, dragon,  undead, phantom, or evil.  Each time you attack an enemy with one of your  several weapons, that weapon will grow better against that enemy's class,  while growing weaker against a different enemy class.  For example: if you  often attack wolves with your crossbow, sooner or later your crossbow will  go up a point against beasts, while decreasing a point against undead.  Also, there are six element affinities in which a weapon can accumulate  strength, and each element is strong against another.  Water extinguishes  fire, air disturbs water, earth blocks air, fire melts earth, and light and  dark cancel each other.  So, since bats are air-based, a weapon regularly  employed against these flying mammals will gradually accumulate strength in  earth, making it a better weapon to use against air enemies.Then there  are the &quot;Chain Abilities&quot; that I mentioned before.  At a point in  the game, your character will learn a few &quot;Chain Abilities.&quot;  Afterwards, each battle you encounter will slowly bring him closer to  learning another.  Each &quot;Chain Ability&quot; has a certain effect,  such as adding 10% additional damage to an attack or healing your character  by 10% of the damage your attack inflicted.  You assign each &quot;Chain  Ability&quot; to a different button on your PlayStation controller, and you  execute them after your initial attack by pressing the appropriate buttons  in the proper rhythm.  So, while attacking an enemy, a player can use his  &quot;Chain Abilities&quot; to attack again, heal himself, and end off by  poisoning the enemy.  By pressing the appropriate buttons at the right  time, the player can have a chain of more than 20 attacks in just one  encounter with an enemy.  This makes battles much quicker.Throughout the  game, players will amass quite a collection of blades, grips, gems, armor,  and shields, which can be combined to create different and better weapons,  armor, and shields.  Combine a blade with another blade to create a more  powerful blade; snap on a grip that may make it even more powerful; place  in a gem or two to improve its attack against certain enemy classes and  elements; and behold!  You have a unique, customized weapon, and you can  even name it.With great gameplay, outstanding grpahics and animation, a  fitting soundtrack, and a good, though complex story, Vagrant Story turns  out to be one of Square's best titles and among my top ten favorites on the  Playstation.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the PlayStation's Best!", "unixReviewTime": 969235200, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2000"}

There really isn't too much in between. It features great characters and one of the greatest stories in any game released to date, but the amount of attention that must be paid to weapons and stats (along with some redundancy in battles) can really turn a lot of people off.Let me start with a bit of the story. In the game you play the role of Ashley Riot. A man who is entrusted with the duty of being a Riskbreaker (essentially a one man army) who is entrusted to enter the lost city of Lea Monde to try and figure out an assassination plot that he has been framed for. At the start of the game this is all you know. You know that Ashley went to Lea Monde and was never seen again. Three days after he left, they declared him the murderer. Now you have to find out what happened in the city of Lea Monde and uncover the truth. With a supporting cast of characters lead by the wonderfully evil Sidney Lostarrot, Vagrant Story weaves an amazing tale of lost pasts and hidden truths (with some black magic and whatnot thrown in). Be aware though, the story isn't all happy like you will be apt to find in the Final Fantasy series, it goes much deeper into human emotion and psyche.As for the gameplay, well, this is where it is either won or lost. Essentially the game is a dungeon crawler that has you wandering the dungeons of Lea Monde until you find a neccesary item to continue traversing through. There is a lot of backtracking but luckily half way through you learn a teleport ability that cuts down on that. You can think of it as similar to the backtracking in Resident Evil games for those familiar (find a locked door, need such and such key/item, find item/key elsewhere, go back and proceed).All the while you will be encountering various monsters of different classes. While it may not seem like much, monster class is critical to how effective you are at the game. You have the ability to craft your own weapons and armor, each one can have special affinities to different classes. Essentially this means you will want a weapon that is effective against each different enemy class. This is where all the in depth stat management comes in (as well as a lot of use of the EQUIP function....). Attacking enemies is done in real time and allows you to pretty much attack indefinately as long as your timing is good for chaining attacks together. On top of that you can target individual body parts on every monster to weaken different stats (legs = movement, head = intelligence, and so on and so forth). By doing this and inflicting enough damage to one body part you can effectively nullify your enemies strength. Although it can be apt to take quite a while.Graphically, the game is fairly bland even for PS1 standards. It is made almost with a sketch visual, where there are multiple lines to every section of the characters (similar to what you would see in preproduction sketch books). Although it does work extremely well and seems perfectly natural in the twisted reality that is Lea Monde. All scenes are done in the same graphics engine (no CG) and there is no voice acting so all words are said in speech bubbles. Again, odd, but it works.The game is definately quirky and is definately a bit of a niche game. It is pretty long and requires the player to really get in depth into what they are doing to truly appreciate all the work and the amazing world that has been imbedded into Vagrant Story. If you can do that, it is one of the most rewarding gaming experiences you can have. If not, then consider your self one of the masses, because that seems to be the general view of the game.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An amazing game that is certainly not for everyone", "unixReviewTime": 1157500800, "reviewTime": "09 6, 2006"}

Malone", "helpful": [29, 40], "reviewText": "This game is about to get a lot of attention, more attention than it's had in the years since its Spring 2000 US release. Final Fantasy XII looms on the horizon, and it's the creative vision of Yasumi Matsuno. Vagrant Story is another of Matsuno's brainchildren. Once FFXII has been out for a couple of weeks and everybody's beaten it, a lot of those people are going to find out about Vagrant Story for the first time and go scrambling over to eBay to get a copy. This review is for them.Almost everything about Vagrant Story is par excellance. The story, the script, the characters, the graphics, the soundtrack... The English translation is especially spectacular, due to its masterful coloring with \"Olde English\" which adds so much flavor to the tone and atmosphere. This is one of the ultra rare cases where the English translation is arguably far superior to the original Japanese script. Unfortunately, all of these shining examples of fine craft and \"video game design as true art\" is all for naught because of one single fatal flaw: The game simply isn't fun to play.Where the game ultimately fails is in the game play. First of all, the game is extremely focused. It's all dungeon crawling and fighting. There are no towns to explore and shop in, no NPCs to talk to, no minigames. Once you enter the dungeon, that's it. You will progress through different areas and get a change in scenery from time to time, but there is almost no variety in the gameplay. You move from room to room, you solve the occasional crate puzzle, and you fight enemies. End of story.The battle system in and of itself is fine. It's an interesting hybrid cross between standard real time action combat and traditional RPG turn based combat. The problem is, at the very heart of the battle system is an abysmally UN-fun weapon and armor system. There are several (eight?) classes of enemies in the game- Beast, Human, Dragon, Undead, Phantom, etc. The enemy classes are paired off into diametric oppositions. e.g. Using your weapon against a human enemy will make it stronger against humans, but weaker against phantoms. (sic) On top of that, there are specific weakness ratings. An enemy might be weak against blunt weapons, but almost totally impervious to edged weapons or piercing weapons. And then there are the usual elementals as well- fire, ice, earth and so on. Finally, each of your weapons has its own \"wear\" rating. The lower the rating, the more worn out the weapon, the less damage it does. You must repair your weapons in workshops, which are few and far between in the game. Another thing you can do in workshops is disassemble your weapons and reassemble the parts to make new weapons. Whether the new weapon will be better or worse than the weapons you sacrificed to make them involves much trial and error. The end effect of all of this is that as you play the game, you are literally constantly changing weapons. Yet the creators of the game didn't bother to implement any sort of quick menu for weapon switching, a la Secret of Mana. You have no choice but to spend 45% of your game time opening the main menu, opening the weapon menu, finding the right weapon, opening the accessory menu, changing the elemental jewels on the weapon, etc. etc. etc. All they had to do was come up with some sort of quick menu for changing weapons, as Seiken Densetsu 2 did seven years earlier. As it stands, Vagrant Story is a micro-management nightmare. To call the game tedious is an understatement of epic proportions. There are those who insist that a viable alternative is simply slogging your way through the game using whatever weapons you happen to have, whether they're effective or not. It can be done, but it makes the game even less fun. Why anyone would want to take on a boss with several thousand HP by doing only 1-3 points of damage per hit is beyond me.As is always the case, no matter how flawed a game may be, there will be a small niche group of vocal supporters who insist that it's the greatest game ever created, and that people who don't like it just don't \"get it.\" Beware of misguided fanatics. But hey, then again you just might end up being part of the 5% of people who play this game and come away thinking it's the bee's knees.EDIT- Apparently the star ratings aren't displayed exactly as they were input.

However, after hearing some more about Vagrant's storyline, and its similarities to Parasite Eve (my favorite PS game ever), I tried it out.  Result?  I have a New Favorite PS Game.  Gameplay-wise, Vagrant Story is a mixed bag:  it's too action-oriented for RPG purists, and too RPG-ish for action purists.  To me, it combines the best features of RPGs and action-adventure games, resulting in one of the most innovative, challenging, and gripping games I've ever been lucky enough to experience.  Using manga/comic-style voice bubbles was a stroke of genius -- too often voice translation RUINS games.  It's hard to believe the fading PS can produce such incredible graphics.  When the Wyvern came crashing through the ceiling at the game's beginning, my heart lept.  The &quot;hero&quot;, Ashley Riot, is one of the most intriguing characters ever.  I was unsure until deep into the convoluted, immersive plot if Ashley's intent were for good or ill.  The story is fantastic, the characters memorable, the soundtrack and sound effects atmospheric perfection, and even the dialogue is amazing.  And the battle system....ah, the battle system.  It's a masterful blend of strategy and reflex.  First you must choose the correct weapon with the correct affinity -- doing this is half the challenge.  For example, you'd want to use a weapon with fire-based affinity against, say, a water elemental, AND you'd want to make sure your weapon has a high Phantom class ranking (an elemental is considered a Phantom class creature), in order to have a maximum chance of inflicting a maximum amount of damage.  Then, timing becomes precise as you could allegedly Chain attacks together until the end of time, although a Risk factor (which simulates tiredness during battle) makes this highly unlikely.  Ashley also has defense abilities that could, in theory, render him impervious...with the right decisions and perfect timing (and Risk allowing).  How's that for a twist?  Add to that various spells, both offensive and defensive, and Ashley is a force to be reckoned with.  Add to THAT his determined nature and hazy memory, and you have an unprecedentedly heroic character.  As you wander the dungeons beneath the city of Lea Monde in pursuit of the mysterious Sydney Losstarot, Ashley will encounter dozens of creatures:  bats to dragons, zombies to minotaurs, ogres to elementals, and enemy human soldiers, many of which are Ashley's match, physically and/or magically.  A battle I fought against a particular dragon lasted almost thirty minutes!  But Vagrant Story has more to it than a shining battle system.  The story is told through seamless cutscenes that are a Square trademark, bearing you along with revelation upon revelation.  And if that's not enough, after playing through the game, you gain access to new areas, foes, and weapons -- talk about replayability!  Vagrant Story is one of those games that demands a lot of time to experience fully, and rewards without question.  It has as much depth as any game I've ever played, both in terms of gameplay and story (plus I love the fact you can name your various weapons -- watch out for the Brain Flayer!).

I bought Vagrant Story over a year ago.  Tried it, like the battle system, and then found myself hating it.The game play goes as follows: You start in a dungeon...there are cut scenes from time to time, but none of them make any sense...you run around by monsters and fight.  You see the monsters as you are fighting them as there are no random battles.  A menu pops up after you click near a monster such as, Head: 0, 100%, Right Leg: 2, 85% and so on.  From there you choose which part of the body you want to attack.  Sometimes you make NO hit points against the monsters because you have to work up your weapons for each type of monster.  And it is impossible to make a master weapon against all monsters.  More than one weapon has to be leveled up for different monsters, and many times weapons have to be changed in midst battle which is annoying.  The other complaint I had in this game is that the only way you can heal yourself is either finding a save point or using a curing item.  This doesn't sound so bad, but curing items CANNOT be purchased.  Instead they only can be found fighting monsters.  I never seemed to have enough curing items.  By the end of the game, things still didn't seem to make sense.  The conclusions were unsatisfying and overall pain in the neck.The last complaint I have of this game is the feeling I got from playing it.  The color scheme is bad.  Everything was shades of brown or blacks and occasional greens and reds.  It was a depressing feel to it, and it seemed like I never saw the light in that game.However, I can still give this game some credit.  I believe that it was an attempt of a good thing.  There were bad qualities about it that if only fixed a little, this game could've been great.  The battle system was actually fun at times, but when things got tough and a new type of monster approached, it took way too long to level up a weapon.I thought for its time, the cut scenes looked nice.

Throughout the game, you'll attempt to clear your name for being accused of murder while uncovering remnants of your past. Vagrant Story proves you don't need an overly epic storyline to make a game impressive, and this game definitely has one of the best scripts ever written for a video game.Unlike other big-budget Square titles, which the storyline or visuals are the dominating aspects, gameplay is the star of Vagrant Story. As fair warning, this is NOT a game for casual gamers, which someone can just pick up and play. While battling, you target enemies' bodyparts with the use of a sphere grid. You'll learn to chain combos but your \"risk meter\" will rise, making you more vulnerable. You'll also learn to forge your own weapons and armor, do puzzle-solving and much more. The visuals are outstanding. You feel as if you really did visit Lea Monde with its dungeons and ruins. The character designs are equally amazing and the graphics push the PlayStation to its limits. Sound-wise, the music is hauntingly atmospheric and everything from the grunts and groans of monsters to the sounds of magic spells accent the game perfectly.Although the difficulty level is a bit high and requires some patience and even frustration, it will still be an interesting but rewarding experience for anyone who really does get into it and understand the gameplay fluidly. The amount of time and effort you put into the game will determine how much fun will you have in the long run.

The game isn't too beautiful artistically, and you feel as though the designers did not put much energy into the game. Not to mention that part of the team that did final Fantasy 8 worked on this project. It just seems as though the game was lazily created. The plot doesn't move you at all to continue the game, it's a basic hero fights villian and save the girl story.The turning points of the game are the fighting system which allows you to strike select areas on your enemies body. This at the time was new and innovative, but not verywell executed seeing as it makes little difference with the risk meter involved. The risk meter is a gauge that increases as you fight your oppenents. As the gauge fills up,your chance to hit goes way down. This really is a down point of the game as it is not necessary and makes the game more difficult that it needs to be.The overall game itself is pretty boring to say the least. The aptmosphere is again in a dark dungeon the entire game, which gets tiresome and becomes an eyesore. Mainly because you feel as though your in the same area the entire game. Vagrant Story could of had much potential, but its repetitive gameplay and aptmosphere leave this one bitting the dust.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Bring your pillow ZZZZZZzzzzzzz.....", "unixReviewTime": 1231891200, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2009"}

VanPortfliet \"Matthew san\"", "helpful": [9, 11], "reviewText": "Recently on G4 Tech TV I was watching \"Filter\", and they were counting down the top 10 underrated games of all time, and to my amazement and joy, Vagrant Story was rated the #1 most underrated game ever. There could be no title more worthy, and it saddens me that it has a 4 star average here on Amazon, though it's not really suprising.Vagrant Story was one of the final Square games to come out for the PS1, and went by almost unnoticed. I didn't actually play it until it was a couple of years old. The graphics are without doubt some of the best ever seen on the PS1. I wish we could have had voice overs in this game, but such things were still pretty uncommon on the PS1. The sound is very good, light on music and heavy on creepy, atmospheric sound effects that really enhance the feeling of being lost in the huge mazes of buildings, tunnels, and dungeons.As it is, the dialogue is absolutely exceptional, and the story is complex, twisting, and really makes you think. Good and evil end up not being quite what you think they are. The story has a heavy emphasis on a religious, crusader/inquisition type group of characters, as well as incorporating sorcery and magic. I could never explain how great the story and characters of this game are...it's just magical. The world just sucks you in.The entire game takes place in an old abandoned ghost town on an island called Lea Monde. It is one of the most phenomenal environments ever created for a game. Much of the game takes place underground in old tunnels, vaults, caves, storage areas, and a huge variety of buried rooms, but there are also many areas where you emerge and have to explore the city aboveground. The feeling of the game is very lonely, and the old abandoned town of Lea Monde is amazing to explore.The amount of detail that was put into this game is just incredible, and it is evident at every moment just what a labor of love it was for those who made it. Not only is the game itself exceptional, but the plethora of details they incorporated makes it an all time classic. For example, on the map screen, every single room in the game (and there are a lot) has it's own unique name. There is one dungeon where every room (and there are at least 30) is named after an implement of torture! It's just great.There is a huge variety of enemies, and an in game encyclopedia that fills up as you encounter them. Combat is very difficult, and it seemed to me at first even too difficult, but once you get the hang of it, this game has one of the most fun, and definitely most unique, combat systems ever devised. With each swing you take, you can choose where to aim on the enemy (left or right arm, legs, body, or head!), and depending on the enemy, armor, and what type of weapon you are using, you will have a different %chance of hit and damage. There are about 6 or 7 types of weapons (blunt, piercing, slashing, etc.) and a HUGE variety of different weapons within these categories. Within this there are different gems that can be attached to your weapons to make them more efficient against certain types of enemies, give them elemental attributes, etc.Truly, this game has an almost intimidating amount of detail, but that's what makes it so great. You can armor all parts of your body, and every single weapon and every single piece of armor is customizable by combining lesser weapons and armor in workshops that can be found among Lea Monde. Materials range from course materials like wood and iron early in the game to silver and platinum materials later. Weapons have to be created and specialized in for different creature types. For example, I usually had a spear I used against dragons, a holy mace and a holy dagger for undead and zombies, and an axe that was most effiecent against humanoid creatures. Plus, you can actually name every weapon you create, which adds an awesome finishing touch to your arsenal.There is so much about this game that is great that I could go on for another hour and hardly scratch the surface. This game is thought provoking, its deep, and it is CHALLENGING. Not for wimps! There is so much to explore, so many hidden features, such endless customization, this game just never gets old. And, it has a new game plus feature, so you can replay it with all the skills, equipment, and magic you've acquired. Damn, I didn't even touch on the magic...there is a huge variety of magic spells you can learn as well!I've played through it probably 3 times over the past few years, and it remains fun every time I play, and I still haven't maxed out Ashley Riots potential.This game may not be for everyone. It is hard, confusing, and very deep. But for those of you that love fantasy games, a good story, great characters and dialogue, tons of character/equipment customization, and a big challenge, give this game a try. You can get it for cheap now, and even though it's a little dated, it may be one of your best game purchases in quite awhile.On a final note, I'm thrilled to know that the people who are responsible for this game and for Final Fantasy Tactics are the main creative force working on Final Fantasy XII right now. It should be phenomenal! I can't wait.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the Greatest Games Ever Made for Fantasy Fans", "unixReviewTime": 1105747200, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2005"}

{"reviewerID": "A29BQ6B90Y1R5F", "asin": "B00004SPW9", "reviewerName": "S. Rhodes", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "In the year 2000, Squaresoft was pretty much at the top of its game.  In that year they had a string of successes with games like Chrono Cross, Legend of Mana and Final Fantasy IX all dropping by for some time.  Strangely enough one of the most overlooked games during that time was a little gem called Vagrant Story.  Helmed by Yasumi Matsuno (better known as the mind behind Final Fantasy Tactics), it was a game that he knew from the moment it came out would only appeal to a particular crowd.  Vagrant Story wasn't for everyone.  Indeed, many a gamer either couldn't get into it or downright hated it.  Those who did get into it, however, fell in love with the game.  Matsuno has always had that &#34;You'll love it or hate it,&#34; appeal.  This may also be because Matsuno's approach to designing a game has always been &#34;different&#34; than the typical developer.  There's no game in Matsuno's library that is as complex as Vagrant Story, however.  If you can get into it it's a rewarding and challenging experience.  Patience is required but for the time of its release it was probably one of the most reaching and original games out there.Vagrant Story is set in Valendia.  A cult lead by a man named Sydney have abducted the Duke's son and taken him to the abandoned city of Lea Monde.  As Ashley Riot, your job is to infiltrate the city, find the Duke's son and stop the evil cultists.  Throughout the journey you'll also run into the Crimson Blades who are also out to stop Sydney for their own reasons.  As Ashley enters the city of Lea Monde he gets caught up in a game of cat and mouse with Sydney, who has a mysterious power to see into the past of his victims.  As you play through the game there are many moments of betrayal and characters out to serve their own ends.  It seems like a simple story at first, but as you dive deeper in it becomes more complex and engaging.  Though there are moments when it's slow, Vagrant Story isn't exactly long enough to mind some of its pacing problems, the likes of which are slowed down less by the actual progression of the story and more by the actual gameplay itself.In the year 2000 most JRPGs were the same old typical turn based stuff.  Allies lined up on one side, the enemy on the other.  Vagrant Story does away with that.  Instead it takes on a more active approach to its combat.  You can walk around in normal mode or battle mode.  In normal mode your weapon is sheathed, as is your shield.  In Battle Mode you are ready for combat at any time.  Enemies roam around the map freely.  Vagrant Story fashions itself as a dungeon crawler.  Many dungeons are quite big.  When you enter a room there are usually two or three enemies.  When you engage them in combat you must bring up a battle sphere (referred to as a matrix).  Upon doing so you can select a different part of the body to attack.  Either their right arm, left arm, legs, body or head.  Each one affects different stats in some way and has its own HP listing.  For instance, if you keep attacking an enemies legs you'll reduce their movement.  Keep attacking their primary arm and their attack goes down.  Keep attacking the head and they'll eventually be silenced.  Keep attacking the body and their defenses drop.You can also chain together attacks by setting them to different buttons.  The more you chain attacks together the greater damage you'll do.  Some chain abilities are designed for damage output but others are designed to restore HP or MP while others may silence or paralyze an opponent.  Chain attacks take time to master, however.  Each time your weapon strikes an enemy you have a brief second to hit a button.  If your timing is correct Ashley winds up for another strike.  Hit the button too early or too late and the chain stops.  While it's easy to chain attacks together, the game makes sure you don't take advantage of it by giving you a stat known as Risk.  When your Risk is low your is high and you take less damage.  As your Risk increases your accuracy drops and you take more damage.  On the other hand Risk does have its upsides.  You have a better chance of landing critical strikes and your healing magic will heal far more HP.  So you can take your chances.  Your accuracy is lower but your damage output (if you hit) is higher.  You take more damage but you can also recover more damage.There are also defense abilities at play that work exactly as you think.  When an enemy strikes you, just hit the button corresponding to the defense ability set to it and Ashley defends himself.  As with chain abilities the timing is important.  Some defense abilities allow you to reflect damage, others let you absorb HP and others are just meant to help your defense against certain elemental attacks.Vagrant Story has a deeper system than most games and we've only scratched the surface of what it is.  Certainly there are also various magic spells but they're used in the standard fare you would imagine them to be used in.  First you use a grimoire and then Ashley will master the spell.  Some require specific targeting but for the most part there's little complex about using magic in Vagrant Story.  What is complex, however, is keeping so many things in the background in mind.  For instance, every enemy has a class they fall into.  Human, Dragon, Beast, Phantom, Undead or Evil.  And they're all weak to a very specific weapon type.  We're not talking swords or anything like that.  We're talking either edged, blunt or piercing weapons.  Likewise, you also must pay attention to the elemental affinity of a weapon you're using.  Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Evil and Light.  It seems like a lot to take in at first... and it very much is.  Using the right weapon against an enemy makes the difference between dealing a lot of damage or dealing no damage at all.The good news is that all of this can easily be manipulated through the games various systems.  You might start with a sword that doesn't deal a lot of damage to humans at all... but the more you use it the better it will be against human type enemies.  You can raise any weapons attack against a certain class just by using it on that class.  Thus, you do more damage the more you use a weapon.  Likewise, as you go through the game you'll find various gems to attach to a weapon as well to help improve how much damage you can do to a class.  Some enemies have elemental weaknesses as well which you can also attach gems to your weapon to exploit.  It's not just your weapons, but your shields as well.  You can easily attach a gem to a shield to improve your defenses against various classes and affinities as well.  All this amounts to a fairly complex game when you consider all of this.  But it also means that you'll find yourself constantly micromanaging throughout your journey.  You'll enter one dungeon where a weapon you've obtained and attached gems to works really well only to enter another dungeon where you have to change all of it.  It is certainly possible to go through Vagrant Story with just a single weapon, but you'll feel the need to change it up eventually.  Not only do all those class and affinity matches matter, but eventually you'll want a weapon made out of a different material as well.  You start with a lot of Bronze and Iron stuff that affects class and affinity damage, but you'll also find yourself using better material later that deals greater damage with little or no penalties at all.Vagrant Story is actually a game that, if you grind enough, can be really balanced with its complex weapon system.  Every weapon has the ability to grow its class and affinity damage.  And wouldn't you know it, Vagrant Story makes sure you CAN do this.  Later in the game you'll come across various workshops that will allow you to make and combine your own weapons.  You could easily make a weapon that deals heavy damage to every class and affinity type in the game.  It takes a lot of grinding, but it can happen.What's nice, however, is that outside of the boss encounters the game isn't too punishing.  If an enemy is weaker to a blunt type weapon but you prefer your edge type the damage isn't nearly as well affected as your class and affinity are.  Even so, however, there are lots of spells that can be used to boost any affinity you're lacking or that can be used to strengthen your attacks and equipment.  Likewise, you'll have plenty of spells that can decrease your enemies stats as well.Unlike most games, Vagrant Story wants you to learn and utilize every bit of its system.  Particularly in its boss encounters where knowing the class and elemental affinity of your opponent is your key to victory.  Vagrant Story is a challenging game, but only to those who do not understand the mechanics of the system.  If you're fighting a water elemental enemy for instance, just boosting your attack and casting a spell that boosts your weapons fire affinity (as well as having the proper gems) will save the day.  If, however, you're not willing to micro manage and prepare for each boss, Vagrant Story is more than happy to punish you for it.  This is not a game where just knowing the basics will help you succeed.  This is a game that expects you to actually learn and utilize the system at play and isn't going to hold your hand to get you there.  If you aren't willing to read the game's instruction manual (or willing to read the Quick Manual in the game itself) then you'll find Vagrant Story to be a challenging and frustrating endeavor.  If, however, you spend the time to learn the complexities of the system, Vagrant Story is surprisingly easy.  The most challenging boss won't be a match if you understand what to do.About the only thing that might hold you up is that Vagrant Story is large and sprawling.  The dungeons are huge, but more than that, the game isn't always telling you where to go next.  You'll often come across locked doors that you need to have a certain key or sigil for.  And when you get that key or sigil you'll need to find the door itself.  The good news is that while the game won't guide you back there, it has lots of tools to give you an idea of where you can or cannot go.  Each sigil has flavor text that tells you which dungeon it can be used it while the in game map always marks locked and unlockable doors for you.  Again, if you're not willing to utilize the system you'll be hopelessly lost.  You may still get lost, however.  While you'll know which doors can and cannot be passed through thanks to your map, the game still doesn't tell you WHERE you need to go a lot of the time.  There's a lot to explore in Lea Monde at least.  It's a huge game where there are lots of things to do off the beaten path.  Going back to old dungeons and grabbing equipment from otherwise locked chests or rooms is nice.  It's a shame, however, that most of Vagrant Story's best optional content is saved for after completing your journey.  Much of what you do must be done in a New Game+.  Many of the optional bosses and optional dungeons can only be played on replay.  While this sounds like a chore at first, it's remarkable how fast Vagrant Story moves.  Your first play through may take a moment because you're getting lost, but once you've experienced it once you'll come to learn that Vagrant Story is a pretty short game.  In a New Game+ you'll find these new areas pretty quickly and they'll keep you busy for a while.Vagrant Story is close to perfect for its design.  For everything that seems like it'll give you trouble there is an opposite solution that will always work for you.  However, beyond its complexities what you realize is that Vagrant Story is most certainly not for the fast paced gamer.  It's short, but it won't feel short the first time through.  The battle system will make everything feel slow.  The combat always stops so that your enemies can cast spells and in some cases this is a lot.  Combat may seem very active, but at some point it's the same turn based affair you've always known.  But when enemies and characters take certain action everything stops while it's being executed.  This is not an action/adventure RPG, it's very much just an RPG.  In moments where all you want to do is get through the dungeon without engaging your enemies in combat this is particularly annoying as you'll always be stopped so they can have their attack.  Likewise, as a result of this you'll often have to stop and take a moment to heal any sustained damage.  While it's nice that your HP and MP will regenerate in normal mode, enemies are going to do damage quite fast when you're not interrupting their blows with your own (and even the normal enemies can do quite a bit of damage).Other times Vagrant Story can feel downright unfair.  When I mention about having to really prepare for boss fights or else the game will punish you?  I'm not joking.  There will be bosses that, without the right preparation will take you down with a single cast of a spell.  Other times enemies will employ some strangely strategic tactics to make sure you don't stand a chance.  If you aren't willing to utilize the tools the game gives you it's not going to be a rewarding experience.  In an interview Matsuno described the game as being for &#34;hardcore&#34; players (a definition that has certainly changed from what Matsuno meant then) and he is certainly correct in that regard.  Vagrant Story is a game that the player can't hope to succeed in without fully understanding the systems at play, and the learning curve is a pretty steep one.  Many video games really ease you into things and make things quite easy in the event that not everything clicks for you immediately.  Vagrant Story knows no such forgiveness.  As such many a gamer is probably turned away from Vagrant Story because of its complexities.  There are a lot of things to keep track of, a lot of micromanaging to do and a lot of preparation that comes before every boss at a certain point.  All this culminates into what is still widely seen as a very complex game.  In some instances, without the aid of a walkthrough (at least for bosses) Vagrant Story can appear to be needlessly challenging without understanding the fundamentals of the game.Even for hardcore players, however, some of the micromanaging can be a bit much.  There will be stretches where you'll feel like you're spending more time in the menu than actually exploring and playing the game.  As you use various weapons and grow fond of a favorite this will ease off, but until that point Vagrant Story is pretty strict about it's combat system and is surprisingly meticulous.  There isn't room for a lot of error and sometimes this can be grating to those new to Vagrant Story.  Even intimidating at times.  Many of Square's other games are far more accessible than Vagrant Story.As I said, however, once learned Vagrant Story is a surprisingly easy game.  In fact, it can be a little too easy to get overpowered when you realize just how combining weapons and raising affinities really works.  So much so that it can be really easy to take advantage of it.  Once you know what class and affinity you're dealing with Vagrant Story is a pushover.  To make sure you can't get too overpowered, Vagrant Story has limited inventory space.  You can't simply run around with all your weapons.  Eventually your weapon inventory gets full and you'll be forced to dump a few in a container.  The same goes for armor and other items.  It surprisingly balances the game, but once again, can be a big hassle for those who aren't particularly big on micromanagement.As far as Playstation games go, Vagrant Story was among the best looking ones out there.  Certainly games like Chrono Cross look a little better, but Vagrant Story, especially for all it does at a time, is quite a good looking game for its time.  The art style is very nice.  What really makes it work is the tone that goes along with everything.  It's a very dramatic story.  The dialog is some of the best written in any game Square has ever published.  The presentation is just overall very nice.  The dark and dreary tone is enhanced by the soundtrack which is just as magical, dramatic and dark as the game itself.  Everything about the presentation gives you an idea as to what kind of world you're stepping into.  This isn't a lighthearted fantasy.  A great deal of JRPGs have a tendency to go the more adolescent or more juvenile route with a lot of themes and intrigue, but Vagrant Story doesn't do any such thing.  Many characters are put in situations that feel hopeless at times.  It's a dark story filled with betrayal and political intrigue and it will shove this in your face.  And there are A LOT of politics in Vagrant Story.  And the deeper you dive into the story, the more interesting it gets as revelations are unveiled and character motivations come to light.Vagrant Story is not a game for everyone.  It simply is not.  It's complexities and micromanagement systems can make the experience tedious for some players, while others may be turned away by how difficult the game will be without understanding them--especially because the game will punish you for neglecting to learn any of it.  This isn't a game where you learn the basics and keep going.  This is a game where you MUST dig into the systems and the mechanics because it's unrelenting if you don't.  However, those willing to dive and learn the system will see a Playstation game unlike any other they've ever experienced.  With a great story, some great localization and a very creative battle system, Vagrant Story is a hidden treasure.  It may not be simple and it may not fashion itself approachable, but the more you get to know it, the more charming it becomes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Magical In So Many Ways", "unixReviewTime": 1389312000, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2014"}

This means if you wanted to continue that game you had saved on there, DON'T COUNT ON IT.The door for the game tray is a flip up instead of a drawer.

(Except by starting at the beginning and replaying the game all over again).Maybe I seem a little bitter, but my main grudge is that I just got home from playing a game I started at a friends house, put 4 hours of work into, then brought home. Then I popped the memory card in, played for another 4 hours (all the while, saving and having the playstation tell me it saved successfully).. when I realized that the game I was \"overwriting\" was actually the same game over and over. It never overwrote anything. So now, when I turn off my playstation, there goes 4 hours of work.And what happens when I put in the NEW PS2 Formatted Memory card to see if I can save on that? oh HELL NO.

I enjoy playing the games and they're pretty good.Some of the great things Sony did with their systems are worth a mention.  At first, I owned the 30001 model.  Then, I sold my unit after buying a 50001 model, which included the internet adapter, and now plays DVDs in anamorphic widescreen.  (My old model did not play them anamorphically.)  I bought the newer unit because I read an article in a videogame magazine that said there was a graphical improvement in models 33001 and later.  I don't remember exactly what the improvements were because I read it a long time ago.  These newly-redesigned, slim models make transportation easier.  The power pack is now externally in the A/C wire, which means that's where all the weight went, but the unit is still smaller.Although I prefer the new unit, I have two things, which are not really large enough to make complaints, but they may interest people who are considering buying the new model, or even replacing their old model with the new one.You probably already know the newly-designed PS2 cannot use the hard disk drive that was sold with the Final Fantasy game a while back.  If you bought one of these, you should keep your old one.Another feature that changed is the method of ejecting the disc from the player.  I think the idea of this new design is pretty good for guys like me that like to keep their console close by when they go places; however, the disc now ejects differently.  Before, one could eject a disc by pressing a button and a motorized tray ejected out of the face of the unit; now, it ejects like a portable CD player, meaning it has a lid.  When you press the button, the lid pops upward and the disc must be pulled from a spindle in the topside (if it's lying flat).  At first, I thought the redisigned unit would now fit inside a certain spot in my entertainment center, but I cannot do this because the disc now ejects out of the top, and this means I need room around the top.  Not a big deal, but a factor.That's it, but if I may be critical of Sony for a moment without turning it into a smashing contest, Sony has always had one single flaw they never amend: the accessory-compatibility issue.  First, in all of Sony's PS1 & PS2 machines, there are only two controller ports, which means PlayStation games rarely have four-player modes; so, unless you're a James Bond game fan, you probably didn't pay the $30 for the Multitap.  This reinforces itself: since most people only have two controller ports, PlayStation videogame companies mostly make games that don't utilize the Multitap.  Second, although it isn't hard to get an older model of the PS2, (again) the hard disc drive doesn't work with this new model.  Third, the first, original PlayStation models had a Sony LinkCable port, but the Dual Shock model and afterward (including the redesigned PSOne model) eliminated the port.  This means games you could normally play multiplayer by connecting two PlayStations with the LinkCable, you cannot do this anymore.  Although not many people have the LinkCable, even fewer people have access to the feature now.  Perhaps this has nothing to do with the PS2, but it does help prove Sony's history of designing a machine around its peripherals.  In other cases, the changes were virtually always inarguable improvements to their unit.  Why doesn't Sony make four controller ports?  I don't know.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Info on new slim PS2 & a brief look at Sony console history", "unixReviewTime": 1105315200, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2005"}

Though we all have our opinions on the three systems, the fact is that they are all great systems in their own right. That is to say you won't go wrong no matter which one you choose.Let me reiterate, this is not a bad system. It has several great games (Final Fantasy X & X2, Grand Theft Auto Series, WWE Smackdown Series and several others). Though it must be noted that Gamecube and XBox both have great exclusive titles. The graphics are outstanding and they may not even be the best of the three, but they are great, certainly better than anything we had just a few short years ago. They definitely have more benefits than everybody else (free online gaming, the Eyetoy, and more games. As far as controllers go, I like Gamecube's a bit better, but this controller works wonderfully well too and is well laid out. (You won't be searching for the buttons like you do on XBox controllers, that is my one true complaint with that system).One thing that irks me about the new design is the lack of support for the hard drive.  It's not a huge issue unless you want to play Final Fantasy XI or take advantage of HDD capability as with ESPN NFL2k5.  Not a big deal, but something could have been worked to support it.I do like the smaller, slimmer design.  It certainly helps when you have many systems old and new and are lacking in space to have them all setup at once.  You almost have to see it in person to truly appreciate the size reduction this thing has undergone.  While the old one is regarded as somewhat of a \"clunker\"; this thing is small, sleek, and powerful.  I wish they could have found a way to include four controller ports (should be an industry standard) as opposed to just two.  It's not a big issue but a bit annoying for those who enjoy playing multiplayer sports games.Anyway Playstation 2's biggest downfall is in the fragility of the system itself and though I have experienced no problems personally, I have heard of a few from close friends.1. Disc Reading Error (This is very likely a non-issue with this newer model.)2. Malfunctioning Disc Door (This is no longer an issue because the system is now top-loading.)3. The power cords tend to wear out faster than average. (Not a big deal, the cords are fairly cheap, but it could present a fire hazard.)None of these things would be a huge deal except that the PS2 comes with a measly 90 day warranty (Do I hear 1 year anyone?)I'm not trying to say this system is junk. It does have durability issues more than anything.  Some of these problems should be lessened/eliminated with the new model. I personally prefer Gamecube but only by a small margin. All of you who immaturely spout \"PS2 rules, Gamecube & XBox suck\" are not only lying to yourselves, you're doing a great disservice to the readers who depend on these reviews to make an important decision.The bottom line is the Playstation 2 is a great system and definitely worth the money, but it is not gaming perfection as some make it out to be.

This system is completely pointless and insufficient compared to the original PS2.  I love Playstation, but I cant give this system praise like all the other PS2 fans out there because it was made by Sony.  Here is how it is-Xbox is a much better system, PS2 has many more fun games to play.  Put the two together and it would be impressive at least.  I suggest anyone looking to buy the new PStwo to spend the extra $40 and get the original, or an Xbox.

So I played PC games for years. The reason I switched to a console was to avoid clogging up my PC with software, drivers, peripheral hardware, IRQ conflicts, and other things that cause the Blue Screen of Death in Microsoft Windows.The question was, which console to buy: Playstation 2, XBox, GameCube, or PSP?Sony made the answer fairly easy: The new PS2 is portable, relatively inexpensive, doubles as a CD/DVD player, and most important, has thousands of titles available with backward compatability both now and in the upcoming Playstation 3.The console is incredibly portable (it has a wall-wart for power, however). The games I've played so far (about a dozen) have excellent graphics and gameplay. Best of all, the games WORK--no crashes, no fiddling with sound and video cards, no Blue Screen of Death. For all of Microsoft's babbling about \"Plug and Play\", Playstation 2 is the only computer device I've seen that actually does it.The only reasonable competitor in terms of number of games available is XBox. But there are a lot of things going against XBox:1. Graphics vs. Price: XBox 360 graphics are known for being \"better\" than PS2, but you have to be pretty picky to notice the difference. PS2 games look fantastic, and just keep getting better. Any difference that exists doesn't justify the price difference. Not even close.2. Portability: XBox is a big clunker. PS2 is only slightly larger than the DVD cases the games come in. I can travel with it easily.3. The Future: PS3 is coming out in November 2006, and it will surpass XBox 360 features in every way (including HDTV). And it will play all previous Playstation games.4. No Guitar Hero: Guitar Hero is (currently) available only for the PS2. And Guitar Hero is too good a game to miss.5. Bill Gates: XBox is a Microsoft product, and Microsoft's legacy is to be known as the only company to consistently produce products that don't work for a quarter of a century. Otherwise I would have been happy to keep my games and computer software all in one machine.The bottom line is that I had my PS2 playing games within minutes of opening the box, have enjoyed them more than any PC game, and it has never, EVER crashed--No Blue Screen of Death. If I decide to get a PS3 later, I can still play all my current games.And they just dropped the price by $20 in April 2006.The only thing I don't like about PS2 is the need to buy ridiculously expensive, relatively gigantic memory cards to save games. 8MB cards sell for the same price you can buy a 512MB Compact Flash or SD card if you shop around. The memory card is expensive, huge, and unnecessary. If they can fit 1GB of memory into a tiny iRiver MP3 player, Sony could have fit something--anything--into the Playstation 2. But they wouldn't have sucked their customers dry of cash that way, would they? It smells like MacIntosh when companies use proprietary hardware like that, and the PS2 loses one star because Sony resorted to this sleazy tactic.Otherwise, the PS2 is a five-star product. Aside from the memory card issue, I couldn't be happier with it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A New Convert to Console Gaming", "unixReviewTime": 1145664000, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2006"}

This makes the lens more weaker and it can get dirty more easily than the big PS2 lens.Second the power source for the Mini PS2 is attached just next to it, while you are playing over an hour long the PS2 will overheat more than normal and it can get damage for that, even the lens can get overheated. Instead the old Big PS2 had a separate power source, so that it wont overheat the PS2 nor the lens.Thrid the new Mini PS2 is more fragile, so if you drop it, it will break even if you drop it to the ground from 1 feet above the ground it can break or get damage. Instead the old block PS2 can resist all hard handles... so you just care it and mess with it.To be honest, I prefer my new Old Big Block PS2.

N", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Note: This review is based on this reviewer's experience with one of the earliest manufacturing runs of the new, slim design PS2. It is possible that Sony has addressed some of the issues I refer to in newer runs; though with their track record I seriously doubt it in some cases.In all honesty, to say the PS2 (and the original PS) was/is not a great gaming system would be a complete, bald-face lie. Considering their systems have beaten back competition despite never being the most technologically advanced competitor in the running speaks volumes, but to make such a statement is ultimately misleading. In reality, the PS2's success (and Sony's success for that matter) really has comes from the plethora of great titles from a handful of solid developers, not from the hardware.Playstation's biggest failing (other than the PS2 Hard Drive and any kind of quaility online play) has been overall quality. When I talk overall quality, I don't mean how many polygons the machine can push at any given second as that's relatively unimportant in the vast scheme of things, but rather the machine's overall durability and structural integrity. One might think this re-design might solve some of these issues from the original PSX and PS2. Well, in short, it doesn't.It may be true Sony is not the only company that has had hardware problems cast a shadow over their console (the original Nintendo would be a prime example), but Sony seems defiant in learning lessons from it's own past considering hardware problems have been a consistent factor throughout their history. Here are a few examples concerning the slim PS2:#1: Never buy a slim PS2 and think your going to kill two birds with one stone with a game/DVD combo. This is the biggest misconception people have; over time the PS2 will eventually have trouble running about half of anyone's DVD collection, especially anything that runs off a dual-layer DVD. The fact my Family Guy and Futurama DVD box sets won't run on the machine after having it for a year and a half proves this to me. The PS2 is no substitute for an actual DVD player, so don't be cheap and save yourself a headache and buy a DVD player to boot.#2: The situation with dual-layer DVD's also applies with many games that use the format as well. I can literally spend hours trying to get my Wild ARMS Alter Code:F and God of War to work, yet when I insert the same games into my friends old-model PS2 that is twice as old they work right off the bat. That's not right, especially considering those games where brand new.#3: The fact you can NEVER fully shut the machine off (less you unplug it) like one would with the switch in back of the older PS2's raises too many questions. Anyone familiar with the original PSX knows even when the power was shut off, that it still drew in a minimal amount of electricity. This was probably one of the main factors that attributed to the original PSX's problems. Why would you bring back such a potentially damaging feature? When I turn the machine off, I want it COMPLETELY off. That's what OFF means Sony!#4. Anyone who purchased one of the newer slim model PS2 shortly after it was introduced probably found it nice when there was a voluntary recall on the power pack. Yeah, that just makes me trust in Sony's products even more. The risk of fire and burns always goes well with any gaming experience.Despite everything I have said above, if you like the games the PS2 contains in its gaming library, you're going to buy it anyway (hell, I did). However, as with any system, I would definitely advise against buying any kind of Playstation hardware the minute it comes out (outside of the initial price).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Almost more trouble than it's worth...", "unixReviewTime": 1104278400, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2004"}

This new PSTwo is remarkably tiny, and you almost need to hold it in your hand to appreciate just how much Sony reduced the size of the machine.  The design feels a lot like a laptop computer -- especially the top-loading optical drive -- and is doubtless cheaper for Sony to produce.  This time I feel that we the consumers get a slick product in return for the company's increased profits.  It's delicate, but no more so than the original PS2.There are no major compromises in this machine: like the previous design, it has two memory card slots, two controller ports, two USB slots, a progressive scan DVD player, a built-in infrared remote receiver (for controlling and watching DVD movies), and the AV outputs as the original PS2.  Optional video cables can change the signal from the default component to S-Video or composite, just as before.  An optical audio jack is also present for digital sound output.What's missing?  Not much.  The Firewire port of the launch PS2 has long been abandoned, and is also absent here.  You will need to use a new multi-tap if you want to play one of the few games that support more than 2 simultaneous controllers.  You'll also be unable to plug in the \"PS2 HDD,\" the hard disk drive albatross that will likely never be supported by Sony again outside of the online Final Fantasy game.  No great loss there.As a DVD player, the new PS2 is at least as good as any other lowend machine that does progressive scan and has DTS and Dolby audio and digital output.  I'm using it paired with an official Sony remote and plan to return the cheapo machine I bought when my old DVD player wouldn't change layers on the new Star Wars set properly.  My new PS2 not only performs just as well, it also plays hundreds and hundreds of games for both Playstation 2 and the original Playstation. It also plays DVD-R movies, though not MP3 CDs or VCDs.The machine has a built-in modem and Ethernet port for online play.  There is no additional cost for most PS2 online games, but in my opinion Sony's online implementation is not nearly as easy or smooth as that of the XBOX.Even after this redesign, the PS2 is still the \"weakest\" of the current game consoles (compared to Microsoft's XBOX, Nintendo's GameCube) in terms of graphical power, and despite this new design, is still the most expensive since you will need to purchase an 8MB Playstation 2 memory card in order to save your games and settings.  Nevertheless, it's a great system even if you already own one of the competitors, because of the large software library with many exclusives and lots of quirky Japanese titles.  The new design is cool enough to even warrant getting a second PS2 system even if you already own the original.If you don't have a current-generation video game system yet, and you want one, this would be a good one to start you off.  The PS3, when released, is likely to be little more than an evolution of the types of games represented on this system.  There's a huge number of excellent low-cost games on this platform, with something for almost everyone who loves games.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "DVDs and Playstation games in a slick little package.", "unixReviewTime": 1098662400, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2004"}

The graphics are pretty realistic and the games are a lot of fun.  There are so many features that make it the best gaming system out there.First, it has there biggest game library available. PS2 & PS1 games can be played on PS2 so there's a game out there for everyone.Next, about 85 million Americans (about 7 out 24) own a PS2 so there are a lot of people to play with.  And PS2 gamers are all different ages from five years old to forty year old \"kids\" and probably a lot of people even older than that.Also, The new PS2 model comes with a network adapter built in the PS2 so you are ready to play people online without buying any extra accessories (except a phone (dial-up) or Ethernet (DSL or Broadband) cable).  Some games can play online with a dial-up and Broadband Internet access but most games play online with a broadband access only.  Broadband users need a broadband or DSL modem and an Ethernet cable (wired users) or an Ethernet adapter (wireless users but not all wireless accessories are compatible with PS2 so make sure to check first).  Dial-up users can just plug right into a phone jack and play.  The best part of PS2's online play is that its FREE!!! (unlike XBox for $49.99 a year or GameCube's $9.99 a month for the two games available for online play).Another good thing about PS2 is accessories and games are easy to find and abundant in many places.  I also own a GameCube and games are harder to find and are more expensive.  Also, most GameCube games are intended for little kids and also there are pretty much no online games (except for two).  PS2 games are available pretty much anywhere (I've seen some racing games at Pepboy's and Auto Zone and some games and Menard's [a hardware store in the Midwest]).  Memory cards and controllers are cheap and available in a lot of places.Another good reason is the size.  It's very small (the picture makes it look big).  It's about a little more than an inch high, nine inches long (from the left to the right) and about 6.5 inches from the front to the back.  A vertical stand is available to make it take up hardly any space.One last good reason to buy it is the extra things available for PS2.  One reason is the EyeToy.  Its exclusive to the PS2.  Its like a web cam you put on top of your TV.  You use your body to play the game. (games include fighting a guy, riding a skateboard, heading a soccer ball, using your hands to dance and use maracas, and to swat away evil things.  A LOT MORE games are available).  Also, a dance mat is available for dancing games (like the games available in the arcades).  These games are a lot of fun and make a great game for parties.  One last accessory is a gun controller.  You shoot guys on the screen (for certain games [Time Crisis 1, 2, 3, and more]) like the games in the arcade.Also, PS2 can play audio CD's and DVDs without buying any extra accessories (a DVD remote is available but not necessary unlike XBox).This is why you should buy a PS2.  The numerous features make it a the best system to buy out of PS2, GameCube, and XBox.  For choosing a system, I recommend to choose based on which system your friends have, what games you like on that system, and what features you want.  I recommend NOT choosing based on who has the better graphics or to pick a system for just one game.  PS2 is definitely worth the $149.99 and is my favorite system.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Gamer's Dream Machine", "unixReviewTime": 1110153600, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2005"}

Sony definitely catapulted their way nearly a decade ago with the successful Playstation system. It really became the very first system to really push the limits of the CD-ROM technology, where other systems like Sega CD, Saturn and Dreamcast have failed. Now what was then, still remains as now.The Sony Playstation 2, is a much more powerful video game system that really delivers. This smaller, thinner edition of the PS2, absolutely delivers to where other CD-ROM systems have fizzled. The video game system doubles up very nicely as a DVD Player, for all your movie watching need for films of all kinds. The game library remains absolutely endless for so many video gamers of all kinds that you can play here like Jax II, the reved up Gran Turismo 4, Madden '06, the highly acclaimed Reseident Evil 4, and many others. You also can play games on this system with the backwards compatability from the earlier PS1 pr PSX.  The control of the system is also as unique and similar to the previous edition, but it is very simple to respond, and easy to use for all gamers.All in all, with all the hype for the next generation consoles like the Xbox 360, and the Nintendo Revolution, the Playstation 2 by Sony is a absolute delight for all gamers of all kinds. Even though I actually don't own a PS2, I've played it enough from friends and relatives to know that this game system is a really big bundle of fun. I absolutely recommend this video game system.Price: B+Convience: A-Graphics: A-Sound: B+DVD capability: B+Control: A 1/2-Fun & Enjoyment: B+Backwards compatability on PS1: AOverall: B 1/2+", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Turn Up The Games, Play On", "unixReviewTime": 1138838400, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2006"}

Just pick this thing up and you'll marvel how Sony ever managed to shrink down the PS2 in size and keep virtually all it's features intact.  Just about everything from the original model PS2 is still here, including the features to play old PS1 games and DVD's, as well as a built in modem for online play.  The long abandoned Firewire port is not here, as well as the plug in for the PS2 HDD hard disc drive, which as a previous reviewer mentioned, will likely never be supported by Sony again outside of the Final Fantasy Online failure.  The sliding disc door, which was subject to malfunctions, is also gone here, replaced with a top loading feature.  As for the system itself as a whole, the PS2 stood as the best home gaming console on the market a few years back, but things have changed.  These days, that claim can't be so sure.  Sure, the graphics aren't as superb as they are on Microsoft's XBox, and the online play can't compare to that of the XBox Live either, but the system's exclusive library of game's were at one time second to none.  Since then, Rockstar's controversial Grand Theft Auto series found it's way to the XBox, and some of the past few first party games, particularly the sports titles, have dwindled in quality.  Right now, Microsoft's money making machine has the advantage, but with the upcoming next-gen systems set to flood the market next year, who knows who will come out on top.  That aside, if you have yet to purchase a current console system, the PS2 is an excellent choice to purchase, considering that the system has a huge library of games and possibly the most third party support of any system today.

I have bought the stand to make a vertical system and have some extras like the remote control which I highly recommend if you like to watch DVDs. As a games console the PS2 is the leader and so it has a limitless choice of games, however I will say that for some reason over the past few years there has only really been a handful of solid gaming entries and everything else is mediocre and PC graphics are a way ahead of the PS2 now, so if you are a game player looking for the best gaming experience then the PS2 is not for you. What you need is a new computer and a very good graphics card with an ADSL modem or better. PS2 games can be very expensive (4 top shelf games and you have the price of a PS2 - 20 top shelf games and you have the price of a computer we where just talking about.) If you own a PS2 then a DVD store rental card is a bonus and really that rental store card is what the PS2 is about for you. If you do not have that card then I hope you have lots of money or friends to trade with.I find myself using this box for mostly watching DVD movies and renting games. I buy a new game once every two months (usually a top shelf game) and that keeps me going. For the PS2 I think the type of game that suits the console best is a 3rd person survival game or something like Grand Theft Auto. Beat em' ups are good on it as well. However the PC dominates Sims, RPGs and 1st person shooters. Maybe the PS2 has some influence on sports games like SSX and Tony Hawk but everyone knows that the better experience for these games is on the PC. So what games you prefer really has an impact on if you want a PS2 or not. Maybe a PC is really what you need?I watch lots of DVDs and with the remote control the PS2 plays like a joy including a special region-free disc that you can buy (its dirt cheap) allowing you to watch anything that comes on a DVD. I have found some incompatibility with some movies (2 in 300) but this is mostly the fault of the DVD producers and not Sony. So 99.9% of movies will play on a PS2. That is not bad. The image quality is not the best but pretty darn good all the same. You can also hook up surround sound to the PS2 no problem and play Dolby Digital or DTS. The PS2 does have one drawback in this department though. The internal fan makes a hell of a lot of noise so you need to keep the sound up to send that to the background. It can be annoying at times. As a DVD player the PS2 has really been used to the max and I have only good things to say about that.I have also used the PS2 to play CD music through my televisions sound system. It has made my hi-fi system now redundant. So as a console it has lots of media options other than just the games console and that is what really makes it worth its while. However as a games console I must say that I have not been let down that much (games like GTA: Vice City, Silent Hill 3, Manhunt, MGS, Devil May Cry, made the console for me) but there could be a lot better first class PS2 games out there by now. I think there are less than 10 really outstanding games on the PS2 and a way more options on a PC for better games.Anyway what you like in games is up to you. I have had the PS2 now for years and it is a workhorse that still does its job. I have no complaints about this system except maybe to hope that more developers try pushing the limits of what this box can do. I am currently looking forward to the new Resident Evil game.Pros:- Relatively cheap console.- A wide of variety of games to choose from.- Expandable.- Great DVD player (with remote control improves this vastly).- Reliable and rugged.- A standard that will never phase out.Cons:- Games are very expensive.- The fan makes a lot of noise.- A PC maybe really what you want.- It has taken ages for some good games to arrive.Overall this a great evolution for the games console.

I like the XBox and I highly recommend it to everyone as it is possibly the best \"overall\" gaming console available. My last video game machine before this was the Dreamcast which I still consider as one of the best video game consoles ever released.  Neverless, I have wanted a PS2 system for quite some time since there are so many great games that have been made for it and I had recently heard that SONY had released a newer and smaller version with some improvements. Several days ago after searching around for stores that carried it I finally found a place that had it in stock at one of the large electronics chain stores. A friend gave me  a new DEMO of a boxing game by EA Sports (Fight Night Round 2).After opening the box I realized how small this system was which I really liked.  It is a little bigger (a half inch longer and an inch wider) than the size of two DVD boxes stacked on top of each other.  I popped in the DEMO game and WOW! I love this little powerhouse of an entertainment system.  I actually played the DEMO boxing game for hours. I was so excited about my new little system that the next day I ran out an bought \"Hot Shots Golf Fore!\" golf game, a Logitech wireless controller, and the Sony 8MB memory card.  I have the system set up on top of my rather small bedroom dresser next to a 13 inch TV. I can play music CDs, DVDs (including  recordable types) and of course all PS2 & PS1 games.This new PS2 is really a \"must have\" considering SONY has made many small improvements in the machine compared to the older and larger PS2s.  The new slim PS2 plays DVDs and CDs very well and it supports wide-screen TV format, progressive scan, Dolby surround, DTS, etc.  I did a detailed visual examination of the laser pickup and the rather beefy laser tracking motor and it seems to be really well built despite the new slim PS2's smaller size.  The top loading flip mechanism is similar to the old PS1 design and there are quite a few vents to provide good ventilation for the main processors.  I believe SONY is using a newer, smaller, slightly faster, cooler running PS2 on a chip for the processing. I found the load times not to be a problem and in the system setup you will find settings for faster DVD player tracking and there is even a graphic enhancement setting.  One of the main drawbacks and a big reason for me not buying a PS2 before now was what I read about problems with the DVD disc tracking system which caused read errors, slow load times. There were also problems with jagged graphics in some of the earlier games.  In the games I have played so far on the new slim PS2 I have not seen any of these problems with the machine.  I will admit that the XBox does seem to have more detailed textures and background graphics especially on the massive games like Halo 1 and Halo 2 but compared to the games I played on the slim PS2 I have not noticed a night and day graphical difference between the two machines. It is also important to remember that most software companies write a game title to port across multiple systems. When you get the XBox version it often is not that different or maybe just a notch better graphically than the PS2 version.  When a game is written exclusively for XBox then you can see where the extra power of that system enables more capacity for programming eye candy but this is done most often for the exclusive games.I have not tried the broadband online gaming for PS2 but from what I have read most people agree that the XBox is far superior for online gaming if you don't mind paying the $40-$50 a year for Microsoft's XBox Live subscription service.PROS:  Small footprint, very portable, many small enhancements over the previous PS2 version, built in high speed ethernet and built in modem for online gaming, largest game library of any console, plays DVDs, CDs, PS1 and PS2 games. As of right now while I write this review the online internet game play is free of charge.CONS: Not as graphically powerful as XBox. Not as well designed for online broadband gaming as XBox. The PS2 is the oldest design of the current generation of available console gaming machines (Gamecube, XBox, PS2).  It uses outdated 8MB memory cards and there is no larger capacity hard drive storage like the one that comes standard with the XBox or as was available as an add-on for the older large PS2. You must purchase a multitap if you want to use more than two controllers.Despite being the oldest of the current consoles this is really a great little machine. It is well designed and it seems to be durable. I highly recommended the new slim PS2 to all console gamers even if you are a current owner of the XBox, Gamecube, or older large PS2 game systems.The bottom line...Five Stars!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The world's most popular video game system gets even better!", "unixReviewTime": 1109030400, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2005"}

PS2 is the best because of it's retail value and the fact that it has more games than XBOX and Gamecube and they also have much more discounted games than either of those systems.

Yes, the PS2 doesn't have as good as graphics as the XBOX but at least you dont need a remote control to play your dvds or cds, just use the paddle for PS2.

It has a top loading system,the door pops up . The hole in your game disk clicks into place.Just like a portable CD walkman.It's much ,much ,smaller than the first design. I love the small design. The only negative is no memory card is supplied. The main reason to own a PS2 is ,simply , There's just more games than other consoles. I also own an Xbox . Which of course is the best of all consoles graphics wise ,plus its internal hard-drive. But you need to buy a dvd remote to play dvd's on the xbox.The PS2 plays dvd's  right out of the box.So both consoles,have there little trick to squeeze a little more cash out of your pocket . If you wanna improve graphics on your PS2 ,I strongly suggest you get either an \"S\" cable, Or a component cable. First look at the back your TV ,if you have a black input that's kinda funky looking,thats an \"S\" video input and underneath will be red and white for audio input. If you see any blue input than that means you have also component input which is the best video input for graphics. There mostly on expensive tv's. But most TV'S have an \"S\" cable input which is better graphics than the supplied RCA plugs ,red,white,yellow ,that come with the PS2. You'll notice a difference in clearer graphics with the \" S\" cable ,or even better the \"component\" cable. Sony makes a good \"S\" cable,about $29.00. Ive tried the monster cable's ,but I had some problems with my cable. I'd stick to the SONY brand \"S\"cable.But Iv'e heard that madcatz \"S\"cable at walmart for $10.00 is just as good.With so many good games coming out on the XBOX . It's hard for me to say the new PS2 is a good buy ,not because of quality,but because of price,But $149.99 aint bad and I got a memory card for $19.99 at Circuit City. The PS2 has tons of games .Much more than the XBOX. Maybe wait until there's a good ps2 bundle .But the the new PS2 design rocks.It's highly portable.I have both systems xbox,and ps2. I like PS2 cause it has more games. I like the Xbox because it has better quality graphics,almost computer quality. If I was forced to own just one system. I'd probably go with PS2 ,because there's more games for that console,and it's very small now,and portable,It would easily fit in a backpack. But with HALO2 coming out I must keep my Xbox which is my personal \"favourite\" console system. But the PS2 \"controller\" is the best designed.

However, there are two major problems with the game. They are the computer AI and the overly difficult challenges near the end of the game.Gameplay: 7Virtua Tennis has three different modes of play in which you can play both singles and doubles matches. In Arcade mode you basically play five tennis games. If you want to move on to the next opponent you must beat the current one. If you lose one match you are eliminated. In the Exhibition mode you just play one game with the players and court of your choosing. In the World Circuit mode you must travel the world and play matches of increasing difficulty. There are also training stages. In these you must do things like knock bowling pins down and smash boxes off of the court.There are only two buttons in Virtua Tennis. The A button button is a regular shot and the B button is a lob shot. Lobbing hardly ever works. About 90% of the time you try a lob shot your opponent will smash an impossibly hard to hit shot back in your face. You can also dive for the ball. This almost never works. If you are lucky enough to be able to hit the ball when you dive it will usually go out or leave a very easy shot for your opponent.At first there are eight players to choose from. By playing through the World Circuit you can unlock eight more. Each of them have their own strengths and weaknesses. While some of the players, like Tim Henman and Mark Philippoussis, are fairly well known, none of them are huge superstars. I really don't care about that though.There are also ten courts to choose from. There are four different court surfaces that play quite differently. This is a very nice feature because your strategy slightly changes depending on what surface you are playing on.Virtua Tennis can be very addictive. It is easy to sit down and spend many hours with this game. I found it hard to put down the controller after playing.One flaw in the game is the computer AI. When you are playing the computer it seems like most of the time they have a pattern. Whatever side of the court you hit the ball from the computer usually hits it to the other side. I frequently found myself sprinting to the other side of the court before the computer player would even hit the ball. Your computer partner in doubles is even worse. He simply doesn't do his job. I have felt like throwing the controller through my TV screen many times because my partner would just stand there and let the ball pass him. The computer will also sometimes lunge into your side of the court to hit the ball.Another thing I don't like about the game is how absurdly hard it is to get some of the special outfits. I have spent about five hours trying to get one of them but I still have not been able to do it. It's so frustrating it has actually given me a headache before.Graphics: 8Overall the graphics in Virtua Tennis are good. The courts are incredibly realistic looking and the players are pretty well done even though their reactions repeat frequently. The audience looks very bad when you see them up close. The backgrounds don't look very good either. The court looks so good that you probably won't often notice these things.Music and Sound: 5The music in Virtua Tennis is awful. You hear the same terrible rock music constantly while you play. It seems like it is the same music playing over and over again.The sound is better. The noise the ball makes when it is hit sounds realistic. Each player makes a different sounding grunt. The announcer does nothing but announce the score after every point. Luckily there are no commentators.Length: 6The length of the game is fairly short. The World Circuit should probably take a few days to complete and the Arcade mode can be beaten in less than ten minutes.Replay Value: 9The game is so fun that it can be played over and over again without getting boring. I have played the World Circuit through twice and enjoyed it both times. It might start to get a little easy after a while though.Overall: 7Virtua Tennis is a good game with a few faults.

Burgee", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Sorry about that title, tennis fans, but I don't really get into the sport all that much.  I think it's kinda dull, personally.  Not after playing Virtua Tennis, however.  Why should you like this game?  Here are a few reasons.First, a backstory:  I heard this game ruled on about 19 different levels, so I was curious when I picked it up.  I figured, at worst, I'd just sell it back.  I'd seen it in the arcade and figured there wasn't much to it.  That's not true and true at the same time.The game is REALLY easy to get into.  Once you figure out the play controls, you'll be overhead-smashing like the rest of them, but it doesn't end there.  It's so deep, so intricate as far as shot position and hitting the ball, that you get a rush after a series of volleys and that drop shot makes it past your opponent.  It makes you look into what shot you'll need for what surface:  Some shots (and movements) aren't the same on turf as they are on clay, on grass, etc.  THAT'S what makes a sport game awesome:  When you can play it, not knowing much about the sport, and getting really into it at the end (the NHL series on Genesis was like that).There's a lot of gameplay here, as there are a number of characters to unlock, as well as a few challenging (and fun) minigames.  The minigames are pretty cool and original...using your tennis skills to knock down bowling pins, dropping shots in trash cans, playing Hollywood Squares without the washed-up celebrities or Whoopi....it's really cool.The main reason why I like this game is this:  I have a 7-year-old nephew, and whenever he comes over he makes a beeline straight to my DC.  He's been playing it recently, and he really likes it.  That's why I like it as well:  It's easy to get into (anyone can do it), hard to put down, and it'll keep your guests entertained for hours.  If you like sports games, looking for a party game (4 PLAYER ACTION!!  WHOO-HOO!!!), or something that's not along the same vein as the Resident Evils, Mortal Kombats or other fighting games, pick this one up.  It's easy, fun, and you'll feel unbeatable after conquering one of the harder minigames.As for selling it back, well, get your own, fanboy....", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Who ever thought TENNIS could be so much fun??", "unixReviewTime": 979257600, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2001"}

The graphics are stunning as players look lifelike and the courts truly look as though you're playing at Wimbeldon or the French Open. The gameplay is simple, but also presents a challenge to master, especially in heated two-player matches. The two-player singles matches seem to always be competitive with several games coming to deuces. The world circuit mode isn't as difficult as some here have said, but it has kept me busy with the many levels and training modes that must be completed. I'm not sure why Sega chose not to include women, but it surely was a mistake. Actually, I think more people recognize Davenport, Hingis, Seles, and the Williams sisters than they do the men, besides of course Sampras and Aggasi who are absent in this game. A deeper world circuit mode, more options, and obviously more players would have helped make this game better, but overall there's not a better tennis game available.

Obviously this is an arcade game, and as a result the long-term gameplay  suffers.

Then, it's merely an exercise in frustration with  random training courses, and impossible matches.  The graphics here are  superb, as is the control (mostly) especially since the computer often  cheats FOR you in order to get far away shots.  But the option of only 2  volley styles (standard &amp; lob) makes any sort of strategy a moot point,  and games typically devolve into ragged run-fests.My advice: by all  means rent this title, as I have had loads of fun with it, and I don't  believe a better tennis title (besides Mario Tennis) has been released  since Super Tennis on SNES or ATP Tennis on Genesis.

If you don't own a Playstation, and have never tried Gran Turismo, you should definitely get this game and see what the fuss is about.  Sega GT is a Gran Turismo clone, but it is a good clone, and feature for feature, they are mostly equal.  You still race real street cars on GT tracks, slowly building up your funds and buying more exotic cars.  The gameplay style is fun but realistic.  If you own and love Sony GT, then Sega GT will defintely get you excited about the genre again.So how does Sega GT compare with Gran Turismo?  It's a mixed bag overall -these games are neck in neck for every single feature- but I still prefer Sony GT.  Gran Turismo is has more cars, more tracks, and a better training/liscense mode.  The analog stick on the Dualshock is easier to use, although the physics are practically the same.  If you've just spent 200 hours playing Sony GT, then Sega GT will certainly seem foriegn to you.  The tracks also seem more fun to drive, and GT2 has rally racing, so its like getting Sega GT and Sega Rally in one game.  Finally, there is more soul in Gran Turismo - you can really tell that the developers love cars.Still, Sega GT holds its own in many ways.  While the individual tracks aren't as inspiring, they certainly hold their own, and overall there is a more even progression from long fast courses to tight twisters.  If you like a certain style of driving, you will find more examples of it in Sega GT than in Sony GT.  The graphics are bright and clear, a pleasure to look at, and you can see farther ahead on the track, meaning your driving can be a smug more realistic.  While the analog stick isn't as nice on the Dreamcast controller, the 2 analog triggers are perfect for breaking and acceleration.  It really is the best gamepad overall for a race game.Sega GT adds some needed realism with car collisions.  In Gran Turismo, the cars hardly respond at all when you collide with another one, and I could often come screaming into the inside of a curve and slam into another car, using it for &quot;braking&quot; and thus passing it with extra speed.  Sega GT can cause spins and severe loss of speed when you collide, so making your way through a pack of cars is very intense, and can take the entire race.  Qualifying is now necessary.  In essense, it's a whole new game.Also, Sega GT added a &quot;create-a-car&quot; model, where you build a vehicle from the chassis up.  The bodies are usually based on real cars, so don't expect huge visual leaps forward.  However, these new cars are often completely untuned.  I found I could get great improvements out of the custom cars by tweaking and experiementing with camber settings, gear ratios, etc.  In most normal street cars, the settings are usually set at their optimal level, so this adds another great level to the game for me.  Unfortunately, there is no indepth tutorials on this aspect, but no game yet provides this detail, so it's not required.Get this game.  Like Gran Turismo, Sega GT is a most own.  The differences are negligable, but the fun is not.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Game, but is it a Gran Turismo killer?", "unixReviewTime": 971913600, "reviewTime": "10 19, 2000"}

Stafford III", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "My original modern gaming console was a PlayStation, and one of the first games I bought for it was the original Gran Turismo. It was extremely popular, spawning Gran Turismo 2 and (on PlayStation2) Gran Turismo 3 - each far better than the previous game in the series.Sega GT seems to be the DreamCast response to the ever-popular Gran Turismo series. For a first attempt at this type of ''driving simulation,'' this is an admirable effort... but there is still a long way to go.On the very positive side, the license tests in Sega GT are VERY generous toward the player; whereas the Gran Turismo series sets very high standards, including keeping at least one wheel on the racing surface at all times and not permitting any contact with walls or barriers or other obstacles, the only requirement in the Sega GT license tests is that the player complete a lap at a given course or segment in the time posted. Another great point of Sega GT is the variety of courses available, from two drag strips to a high-speed course reminiscent of the Pennsylvania Turnpike through the tunnels of the Allegheny Mountains to a wintry course to several desert-based courses between tall rock cliffs. The ability for players to create their own cars (which requires A LOT of money) is a novel addition to a ''driving simulation,'' and there are specific licenses and races for which these Original Cars can only compete. Finally, the use of sponsors is great; for each race/series win, each sponsor pays a given amount of money, which can thus turn low-paying races into nice cash machines if a player can accumulate a lot of sponsors.On the down side, Sega GT has some nice cars. but there are relatively few of them, especially compared to Gran Turismo 2. The navigation of the Car Shop to buy the cars (new and used cars are available) is a bit awkward. While there are a lot of tuning parts which can be purchased, there is little effect gained or lost in making adjustments. Finally, car control in general is awkward at best, especially with high-horsepower vehicles; many high-horsepower cars are simply impossible to drive at competitive speeds.For those with young children, Sega GT will be good for the kids as well as the parents - especially since there are numerous pre-owned DreamCasts and associated games available (at least in the States) for fairly low prices. However, those looking for a true ''driving simulation'' would be much better served by acquiring Gran Turismo 2 (for PlayStation/PSOne) and/or Gran Turismo 3 (for PlayStation2).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good, but no Gran Turismo", "unixReviewTime": 1036195200, "reviewTime": "11 2, 2002"}

This game is very involving, and you must expect to spend a long time working your way through it if you want to be successful. While casual gamers are treated to 'quick race' and 'time attack' modes, the bulk of the game lies in the championship mode, which requires a lot of time and effort to conquer. Buying the game just for it's 'single race' mode is like buying a Ferrari just for the comfy seats!You start off with a little amount of money, then you gradually earn money and cars by winning races and special challenges. You might assume that the game doesn't get interesting until you've acquired the Dodge Viper and souped it up, but this is not the case. The fast cars are almost impossible to control on the very difficult courses, so you would be better to use a slightly less powerful car. Of course there are fast tracks where you can be a speed demon, so choosing the right car for the track is important. There are four classes of car based on their engine displacement: Extra, B, A and SA class. At the start of the game you will have to pass tests to earn each license. There are about 24 license tests, all from different manufacturers; if you can beat the current record for each license track, you will win a special 'works car' from that manufacturer. However, you are as likely to win all of these as you are to land on the moon tomorrow. The license tests are easy to pass, but to win the works cars is near-impossible, and will take you a LONG time. This isn't a negative aspect mind you, I enjoy the fact that the game offers so much to do and will keep you playing for months.If you win every race/challenge in the championship mode (of which there are a lot) you will unlock a new mode called 'world speed king'. I can't say much about this though, as I'm a LONG way from seeing it!The control in the game is superb; each one of the 130+ cars handle just as you would expect them to, and tweaking them in the garage makes a noticable difference to the way they perform. Arcade-style-racing fans will find the controls far too twitchy and unstable; this is definitely aimed at simulation fans although the controls can be configured to suit your liking, including steering sensitivity. I have used both the Dreamcast controller and the Madcatz MC2 Racing Wheel, and both worked excellently. For the ultimate experience however, I have got to recommend the racing wheel and pedals - you won't believe how realistically at handles the cars.Although you probably can get through the game without too much mechanical tweaking, you will find it much easier to invest a little time in learning what you need to do to improve your performance. Practically EVERYTHING is adjustable and replaceable, from the wheel base distance to the gear ratios, and you can buy plenty of parts, from $2,600 aluminium hubcaps to $80,000 turbo engine makeovers.Unfortunately there is no online multiplayer option, but you can play with two players using a split screen. You can also connect to the internet to get tips from the Sega GT website (which is, unfortunately, rarely updated) and also register your best lap times - however, don't expect to see your name at the top unless you are prepared to lose all your spare time trying to shave off 2 seconds from your already perfect lap!The graphics are beautiful, there is hardly any draw-in and the frame rate never slows down. The cars are stunningly rendered. Cars are offered from the usual predictable manufacturers, including Toyota, Dodge, Ford, Honda and Mazda. The selection of cars is more than sufficient; I have heard people complain that there aren't enough, but trust me, 130 is plenty. Especially since you can build your own from scratch, and this is where the game gets really interesting.The 'Carrozerria' allows you to build your very own car however you want it, with 2 million different combinations possible. At first you can only build E-Class cars (with a displacement less than 1000cc). To build better and faster cars you will have to pass a series of tough tests in the car you have made. Persevere long enough and you can soon be building 5000cc, 3000hp (yes, you read right) monsters. You will have to build your own cars to enter some of the races in the championship mode, most of which have restrictions on what you can race in. Build as many cars as you like, and if they turn out to be substandard, well then you can always sell them to some sucker in the 'car dealer' option as a 'limited edition concept car'. ;-)  Each car does handle differently depending on how you choose to build it and modify it, and it will take a lot of experimentation for you to get it just right. You can save your cars onto your VMU to rave your friends, which is a nice feature. The game also offers a mini-game for the VMU (which takes up 128 blocks), and you can earn cash and unlock special cars for use in the main game, though if you aren't interested in that then you won't be at a disadvantage. Still, it's a nice little bonus to keep you occupied while you're away from the Dreamcast. The main game uses 42 blocks for its save game file.The biggest drawback about this game is its lack of any damage modeling whatsoever. So, when you crash your brand new Dodge Viper head-on into a wall at 250mph, you won't even scratch the paintwork. You can just carry on as if nothing happened, with just a little rumble on the jump pack to indicate you hit something. This can distract you from the realness of the game very quickly, and that is something no game should do. Given the sheer depth of gameplay though, it is just about forgivable. It would also have been nice to be able to race more than just 5 other cars, but you can't have it all... The menu interface is quite clumsy and can quickly get tedious, but you just have to put up with it. By the way, if you select the 'Internet' option from the main menu, PLEASE remember to save your game beforehand or you lose everything you've done in the previous session. Unfortunately the manual has no mention of this - I learned the hard way!Generally, this is one of the best racers available for the Dreamcast and if you are someone who likes to get really involved in a game then you will love this. However, others need not apply.I would give this 4 and a half stars, but since it is so damn impressive in most respects I'll bump it up to a 5....", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great game, but for commited players only!", "unixReviewTime": 979171200, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2001"}

People who only want to play FPS games for the multi-player death matches and capture-the-flag should look elsewhere.This game's story is based on a trilogy of ST novels called the Millennium trilogy.  The music is great.  The atmosphere can be very spooky and mysterious at times.Parts of the game remind me of Aliens vs. Predator 2 where you are wandering around corridors on a dead ship waiting to be suddenly attacked by an alien, only the aliens in The Fallen are sometimes very hard to kill.  Sometimes you have to scan them with your tricorder and then adjust your phaser's frequency before shooting them will have any affect.  Other times you don't even have a phaser and have to find some other way to kill them.  Until you figure it out you may die a lot.When I played this game I felt like I was watching a movie, but one where I could become a character in the movie.Once you finish playing the game all the way through as one character you can play it two more times as a different character and get to view the story from a different view point.

Briefly, it involves Bajorans and their Orbs, Cardies and the Domoinion and a little bit of a new race not much spoken of on any of the latter series.Technically, the graphics are choppy and ugly at times but you don't really care considering the year this was made.

For example the Tricorder. When I play the game I actually spend most of the time using it. When I beam into a new site for the first time it is the first thing I am compelled to use.  The tricorder is important because it helps you locate objects you need and allows you to scan for shield modulation frequencies so that you can penetrate enemy shields- very important for your survival.Because of this the game creates an authentic Star Trek experience that Elite Force lacks- I felt like a starfleet officer doing things a starfleet officer would do!

Your reward: heavy financial  retribution, and perhaps... (no spoiler here :)You start by breaking  into the company (a nice old mansion in the London suburbs). From the  beginning sequence onward, you just crack safes all night. It can get  pretty addictive! My wife started cracking and couldn't stop until she was  over. The puzzles are varied, a mix of ingenuity, mathematical skills,  resourcefulness, and exploration (curiosity always rewarded). But you don't  need to be a genius: all the hints are scattered in the game. Look at all  the objects, take notes of the objects you cant't take with you, and walk  around until you are stuck. it's then time to think about what you have,  your next step, etc.The game is very well done, despite a couple of  bugs. the most annoying is actually common to other dreamcatcher games for  the MAC PowerBook: they don't handle the trackpad very well, and you can't  scroll your inventory (only beginning and end). Since it's in alphabetical  order, and Key comes about in the middle, it's most annoying. But I  discovered you can get around by clicking very shortly on the scroll  buttons (tapping is hopeless; it always takes you to the beginning or the  end).The game is not that short, and you'll need to take a few pauses,  and restart (unless you're a master safe cracker with an eagle eye). Most  useful is to find the map of the house at the beginning of the game. Avoids  to draw it by hand as you're walking along :) And since time is counted,  you might want to save after each safe, and restore from there once you  know how to crack the next one. Just avoids you to be short of time at the  end. We did it loosely and had plenty of time still left at the end.What  I liked best, is that you can guess. Even if you have not seen all the  clues, but guess how to crack the safe, you can go ahead. That means also  you can redo the game without looking for all the clues (in case you forgot  to save). And you can crack the final safe without having cracked all the  other ones. Actually, we never got around to crack the jackpot safe (it's  apparently random, and you can only try so many times). But we managed to  guess the missing letter anyway. And some of the safes are really darlings:  they'll make you laugh and feel good about yourself!It's a great game, a  great concept, and I'll definitely buy the sequel.

The premise is a simple one:  You're in line for a job at Crabb & Sons safe manufacturer, designer of elaborate safes for the well-to-do and eccentric.  In order to get the job, you must break into the Crabb headquarters and retrieve bits of the combination of the \"master safe\" from safes located throughout the mansion's cluttered rooms.  When you get the combination, you can crack the master safe and retrieve your job contract.  You have twelve hours.The game is played in real time -- you REALLY have twelve hours, and a convenient clock counts them down for you.  I was afraid at first this would be a problem, but it didn't turn out that way;  I actually finished the game in half the time allowed, cracking a few safes every night over the course of a week.  None of the safes is particularly challenging to crack once you have all the pieces, and several are possible to crack without clues, using a combination of inspiration and educated guessing.  (In fact, after cracking a certain safe, I was surprised to find almost the entire solution hidden in another part of the house, which I thought rather unnecessary). But the variety of safes is quite entertaining.  You must do everything from math puzzles, to sliding tile puzzles, to win a game of poker to crack them.The graphics are quite good.  I was amused to see numerous reproductions of famous art masterpieces on the walls, with the heads and faces of the game programmers substituted for the real ones. There are several fun spots, like the computer that plays 30-second satires of real games.  The music was simple enough and somewhat repetitious, but provided a nice background.Two things keep me from giving _Safecracker_ a five-star rating.  One is that the play area/screen size is very small -- only about four by six inches.  I would have liked it to have been bigger.  However, I still had the sense of being immersed in the environment, so it was not a major concern.  The second is that there are numerous red herrings in this game -- hot spots where nothing happens, inventory items that are never used and the like.

I've never been to the real Tower and so can't vouch for its accuracy, but the game certainly provides a realistic graphical environment.  Most of the locations you can visit are not essential for completion of the game, but add to colour.  There are secret passages and rambling corridors galore.The game is also far from straightforward.  Some may see this as a plus, others a minus.  Your mission is to steal - well, actually 'borrow' - three of the Crown Jewels, and replace them with fakes fitted with tracking devices so that another operative cannot steal them.  There is a time limit, so you have to make your moves count (keep saving your game, and replay key scenes if necessary).  You start with a small inventory but quickly pick up a large number of items - both tools of the trade, and various keys and items lying around the Tower.  This can sometimes lead to long sessions trying many different inventory items to see which one works.From soon after the start you can visit most places in the Tower.  This can be irritating as the Tower is filled with information (literally dozens of tourist information boards, books, paintings, items etc) and a couple of these contain vital information for completing the game - but which ones?  It's a laborious process to photograph and read all the information boards in the hope that you will strike it lucky.  Similarly, despite you having some interesting equipment (such as a grappling hook and ropelift) there are only a couple of limited locations where you can use it, which it will probably take you a looooong time to find without a walkthrough.  This means the game is not open to creative solutions, despite the Tower location potentially providing many opportunities.  There's a lot of guesswork rather than deduction involved.Unfortunately for such a potentially exciting story, gameplay is ponderous.  I found new locations slow to load, and although there is much tracking back and forth there is no 'zip' mode to enable you to navigate quickly through scenes.  In addition, the game comes on four CDs which need to be swapped often throughout as there is no full install option.The game will keep you occupied for a while but although the locations are well detailed they lack the wonder of (say) the locations in Myst or other more fantasy-based games.  There is also a lack of much action (you can't let yourself be seen by any of the guards) and the plodding pace of the game engine is irritating.

You have to dodge hoola-hooping women, charging beefcake men, and bees (or maybe humming birds). Just like in the movie, you can grab a bowling ball and shoot these obstacles before they hit you! Occasionally you'll have a chance to grab a skateboard, but that just makes you crash quicker. Can you make it to the end of the block before 200 seconds runs out?The only thing in the game that kinda ties it to the movie is a picture of Marty, his brother and his sister on the bottom of the screen, which fades away as time passes. Of course, I only know this because I've seen the movie, and it really looks more like a picture of George Washington, Jack White and Nosferatu with a bad toupe (now that'd be a great game!). You have to grab alarm clocks to keep it from fading, which makes perfect sense.Let's say you make it through the five or so levels like this, which are all pretty much the same... It'll get you to Lou's Cafe (hey, something from the movie!), but that's when it gets even weirder. &#34;Bullies to go!&#34; it says as Marty walks in. He grabs someone from behind the counter and slides her down to the end of the room. Then it says &#34;Boy, they sure threw you out in a hurry!&#34; and you have to replay the last street level.

But something happened and Konami was granted the rights to produce the sequel. What we have here is a less-than par sequel, but you be the judge. Oh wait, that's why I'M here... :POkay! Allow me to give this game some leeway by announcing it's finer points. Instead of being a platformer like the first game, Batman decided he wants to be in a beat 'em up, which this game reminds me a lot of the SNES version. Except that in the SNES version the tone was darker, there was the ability to use gadgets like the batarang, and you had better level design. This game features, for the first time, health gauges for every enemy you fight, including bosses and makes it easier to see how close to beating the baddies you are. This, along with Batman's creative array of moves (Jump kick, Mega Man slide, and cape swing which takes off one line of health every time you use it) make for an addictive combination that will make even the manliest of gamers have a nerdgasm.Now onto the reason this game has a lower review score. The game's music is really upbeat and happy. If you've played the first game, it's got a rock feel to it. On top of that, the way Konami made this game a beat 'em up and the fact that the story screens are so drab kind of reminds me of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: The Arcade Game... which is made by KONAMI as well. This game retains somewhat of a campy and lighthearted mood amidst a guy in bluish-black latex kicking the crap out of clowns. It makes the entire thing seem so wrong...Having said that, the game is definitelly challenging. Enemies gang up on you like they should, and you need a strategy to overcome the odds. The same goes with bosses, and trust me. I've beaten this game. In my opinion not the best ending, but to make it to the end means that you've just graduated to Batman Forever on Super Nintendo... But this game is better than that one by a LONGSHOT!!!So is it worth a buy? If you have Batman and want to collect the series.

The truth is that I wouldn't have it in my house.On its face, it looks like a great game.  I enjoyed the graphics and sound the first time I fired it up years ago.  The story was fun and silly, and there was plenty of humor in the level design & characters' super-hits.  Then I reached the third level, and the difficulty just shot through the roof.  Perhaps the most telling event was when I attempted to leap the first of the lava pits.  I lined myself up at the edge of the platform, leapt...and passed right through the far bank.  I lost several lives before I realized you have to line yourself up in the MIDDLE of the platform, a substantial distance back.  The game is loaded with counterintuitive occurences like this one.I reached the conclusion that Battletoads isn't really a game.  It's a sequence of button-presses you must execute in a specific order.  You don't PLAY Battletoads, you memorize the sequences, much like those Sega CD games where you just match the on-screen controller directions while stuff happens in the background.  For example, the speeder-bike level is actually harder if you look at the screen.  The best way to play it is to make notes on where the walls appear and look at those, with only occasional glances at the screen to check your position.  Worst of all, there are a limited amount of continues, which is completely unforgiveable in a game demanding so much trial and error.  Subsequent levels are worse, the Snake Pit being my least favorite.I think I only ever beat the speeder-bike level once as a child, then died within seconds of beginning the following ice cavern.  And I'm a player who can beat Contra with one life.  I went back years later and beat the game using an emulator to save states, and you know what?  I still didn't enjoy it.

In gaming culture, this game is home to one of THOSE levels.  You know, the kind that appeared impossible when you first played it, and then . . . after a broken controller and lots and lots of swear words and three hours later STILL appears impossible.Then you YouTube the level, and like watching someone play Eddie Van Halen's Guitar Instrumental \"Eruption\", you see someone pass the level with (oh God) apparent ease!  These players must be cheating!There are lots of levels like this in the NES catalogue.  \"Adventure Island\" 8-3.  \"Ninja Gaiden\" 6-2 and then the end bosses.  \"The Legend of Zelda\" Dungeon Six.  The Dam level on \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\".  (At least with TMNT at least the title of the level makes you feel like you're swearing which is probably pretty cool when you're twelve).  Pretty much the ENTIRETY of the nightmare that is \"Ghost and Goblins\".  Also \"Silver Surfer\".Of course the level I am referring too is the speed bike level, which is the third one early on in the game.\"Battletoads\" is one of those games that Tradewest, the developer, had crafted in hopes of turning into a TMNT type franchise.  Colorful characters, over the top villians (in this case a Darak Queen), and anthromorphic toads.  For early 1990s the concept fit right into popular culture.There's only one problem.  The game is hard.  As hell.Yes, you want challenges. But honestly, so many people stop at level 3 because they can't get past the friggin' stage.  And this was a game marketed for kids.  By the time you give up you're so beat and humiliated you don't want to see another battle toad as long as you live.  It's kind of hard to feel connected to a franchise when you can't even get past the third level.What is so unfortunate is that beyond Level Three there are some intrinsically intriguing, well designed game play (the Surf level, the Elevator Shaft, the Dark Queen's Tower).  Unfortunately most people never saw that game play.  Then there is the Snake level, which is almost as insane as the speeder bike level.  Of course, there is a SECOND speeder bike level, and this time the stones you crash into are MOBILE!An earlier reviewer said that \"Battletoads\" isn't a game, it's a sequence of memorized button sequences.  While that could be argued for a lot of games, it gets to the heart of the main problem with \"Battletoads\".  For a game primarily marketed for kids, the game is simply too difficult for its main audience, and for most other players as well.  Of course, TMNT had similiar difficulty issues, but that was already established.Another rather famous attribute to this game is the co-op game play.  Although Nintendo has said in recent \"Iwata Asks\" interviews that they have been trying to get co-op gameplay in \"Super Mario\" titles since 1988 with \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", other developers were able to get co-op play without issue (this game, \"Contra\").  However, given how frustratingly difficult this game is, there is a gamebreaking bug which if you get to the Dark Queen's Tower with two players (which is highly improbable to begin with - you think the Speeder Bike level is hard with ONE player?  Try TWO!), apparently there is a game breaking bug that completely freezes the game.  That would be so rage inducing I'd probably just throw the NES out the window.Tradewest who owned both franschises did a cross over title, having the \"Battletoads\" team up with \"Double Dragon\", another legendary video game franchise with the 1993 title \"Battletoads & Double Dragon\".  Although Tradewest owned the \"Double Dragon\" franchise back in the early 1990s they have since sold the tile..  Although a genuine cross over, the focus is largely on the \"Battletoads\" franchise.  There are also some inconsistencies between the \"Double Dragon\" canon proper and this title.  The game is also very difficult, just like the original \"Battletoads\", though thankfully there are no God-awful speeder stages or snake stages this time around.Overall, decent game that is marred by its most famous attribute: its difficulty.  And the fact the difficult stages come so early on, it prevents most players from really seeing what the rest of the game has too offer.The video game website IGN rated this title as the 76th greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.(For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games, you simply MUST play \"Moon Crystal\", a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive. The graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo \"Ninja Gaiden\", amazing music, in depth gameplay, and a fantastic storyline. Absolutely amazing!

This game is so unique in terms of mechanics and style. Instead of most platformers where jumping and running is the main focus of the game, Bionic Commando flips that on its head. in this game you cannot jump at all. But you have a super cool bionic arm that has a grappling hook attatched to it, so to get yourself around the levels, you need to swing from platform to platform. The level designs are mostly excellent and takes full advantage of the bionic arm. One thing I love about this game is that your character has a lot of weight to him, he doesnt really move fluently on the ground, but when you swing it is more efficient and faster than walking around, I love this, it encourages you to use the arm in creative ways and fully master it. While I love this game, it has its fair share of flaws, the boss battles are pointless. If you really know this game, you know the many ways to defeat or for the most part completely skip a boss and go for destroying the generator instead of actually fighting them, while I think its cool, I still wish the bosses were more interesting and varied, THAT was fixed in Rearmed though. Also the weapons....they could be better, the game offers different weapons every time you defeat a boss, while the weapons are pretty good, there is no way to switch between them in game, so the weapon I stuck with throughout the entire game was the rocket launcher, because that thing is uber powerful. But those are my only flaws with this game. This is my favorite NES game of all time, any fan of oldschool platformers who are looking for something different should give this game a try.

Bionic Commando for the NES is an excellent game with some inventive 8-bit gameplay mechanics. The story is simple - it follows Radd Spencer as he goes to rescue Super Joe, another commando who was captured by bad guys. Radd is equipped with numerous weapons and a bionic arm to help him rescue Joe and defeat the bad guys. A short and sweet NES backstory in the vein of good ol'Contra.The game is unique in the fact that you cannot jump. Huh? You have to be able to jump to get around the levels right? Not necessarily. In Bionic Commando, your bionic arm acts like a grappling hook and you use it to climb platforms, swing across spike and fire pits, and to pull down out of reach enemies. It's an interesting game dynamic, and at a time when every other game character could jump, it was almost revolutionary. The available weapons are standard; you've got a rifle, a wide gun, a 3-way gun, a rocket launcher, and a bazooka. I think the rocket launcher is the best choice for almost every level. There are also a bunch of items you can find, but none of them are that effective except for the bullet proof vest.The map screen is also interesting. Instead of progressing linearly to the next level, you're in a helicopter and can choose what area you want to go to next, occasionally running into enemy forces and battling them in between levels. It is an original concept that was refreshing at a time when most games went straight from point A to point B. The game is bright and colorful as well, with each level having a different color scheme and enemies. The enemies vary from soldiers with guns and enemy bionic commandos to sentient slime and giant supercomputers. The human enemies you kill drop bullets, which when enough are collected, your life bar extends one point. You start with three energy points and can work your way to a total of eight.The controls are tight and work surprisingly well. Using the arm takes some getting used to, but the game takes that into consideration by making each level depend more on the bionic arm as you progress. By the time you get to Levels 11 and 12, you'll be a master at swinging, grappling, and landing.All in all, a really good addition to the NES library that has some unique 8-bit innovations and is a lot of fun to play.

I beg to differ!)  I just feel Super Castlevania IV is more challenging, has better gameplay, richer backgrounds and music that's simply more awesome (due to be orchestrated).

I loved the first installment, and many great elements were included, such as the level layouts, brooding and haunting music (impressive, even by 8-bit standards), and difficult bosses.  Castlevania 2 took away almost all of those elements for a more non-linear approach, and many fans didn't seem too impressed by that.  It was difficult to understand other characters' conversations, and a no-map feature certainly wasn't helpful (this would later be corrected on the GBA and DS series).Castlevania 3 returned to what Castlevania 1 was, only the designers built on that.  Some of the levels were straight ahead, while you could choose certain paths to progress through the game (I LOVE the clock level!!!).  There were also additions of 3 sidekicks -- Grant, Sypha, and Alucard (yep, Dracula's own son).  Each had their own specialties, but Sypha was my favorite.  She has 3 spells to kill the undead -- fire, ice, and crystal.  You can see the too-cool effect that the ice spell has on Level 6 and Level 9 (i.e., the waterfall parts of each level).By Level 8, it was a reincarnation of the first stage from Castlevania 1, and the music was much better and enhanced.  But don't be fooled -- it's one of the HARDEST, and you are faced with Mr. Grim Reaper himself (he's brilliantly difficult on ALL the Castlevania installments!!)  This is why, when you first start the game, you want to use the password called \"HELP ME\" -- it will grant you ten lives!By the time you finally reach Dracula, you face 3 forms -- one is the vampire form that you are used to seeing, the second is a skull-faced head (pretty gross, too), and the final form is a giant gargoyle.

So your best bet is to get a hold of an actual NES.-There are a lot of differences between this version of the game and the japanese version akumajo densetsu.

Additionally the help character grant was changed substantially for this version, arguably making him much less useful since in akumajo densetsu he had infinite daggers to throw but no melee attack. More importantly the sound of the entire game is different (which one is better is up to opinion, look it up on youtube if you want to hear the differnce). Unfortunately it is a pain to get the Japanese version working as it was intended, since if you get pin converter and play the game on your NES you will be missing the special sound. The only way to get it running properly on actual hardware is to have a Famicom or to open up and mod your NES.Regardless of all the complications, both versions are a lot of fun and I personally enjoy the North American copy more.

The NES knock-off controller that comes in the box looks fine at first glance. Pretty much indistinguishable from the real thing, visually, except a QC sticker on the back and the red-lettered Nintendo above the two face buttons is gone. However, when you pick up the controller, you start seeing the problem.The first thing you'll notice is that the paddle is heinously lightweight. It's paper-light. If you put this down with any tension in the wire, or if you accidentally touch the wire, the controller will shoot like a rocket towards the console / floor. And you will be accidentally hitting the wire often, because the wire is several feet shorter than the original controller. That means you'll have to get creative on where you place it - no stashing it next to the TV, it's gonna have to stay near the console. And you are, too, while you're playing.Now I can tolerate how it handles out of play just fine if it plays well. But this is where the generic is just shameful. The original NES controller had a very reasonable roll to the control pad, and some respectable size tolerances on the face buttons. The control pad, for starters, is way too sensitive on the diagonals. You cannot play Contra with this controller, because you will accidentally get up from the prone position with bullets at standing-chest-level on a regular basis. And it's just flat out uncomfortable anyways, being a very hard plastic that has a very sudden &#34;give&#34; to it, as opposed to the original, which was more gradual about the downpress motion. The start and select buttons are plastic instead of that rubberlike material, which makes them clicky and feel far less pleasant than the originals (I wonder if it'd be nice to have all the face buttons be rubber...). The red face buttons are loosely moulded and wobble quite fiercely, but besides the obnoxious rattling won't present any gameplay issues.It's a terrible controller, only good if you need to have a quick Nintendo fix on a left-or-right only game and you just can't stand the thought of buying used.

There are 7 levels with a boss in each one. The bosses aren't that tough and you can use unlimited continues to restart any level you die on. This is good but the tradeoff is if you shut the game off you have to start over from the beginning. So you'd have to beat the game in one sitting as there are no passwords for later play. It wouldn't be fair to compare this game to Megaman, or to even call it a knock off of it. On it's own it's a great game and it's actually pretty challenging for a kids game.

The title is often seen as a companion game to the inferior \"Legend of Kage\", the 1985 arcade title also developed by Taito.In \"Demon Sword\", you play as a kimono wearing ninja who has to assemble the titular demon sword by playing through six levels for the final confrontiaton of the game's villian on the game's seventh and final level.  You actually have the demon sword in your possession at the start of the game, and as you defeat the bosses and proceed through the level, the sword gets longer and longer.You have to love inaccurate box art (the most famous example being the original box art for the first \"Mega Man\" game). On the box art of \"Demon Sword\" there is a half-naked giant barbarian(who looks rather like He-man), gazing at a sword blazing with fire.  Although the barbarian is featured promently in the promotional art, this portrayal has absolutely nothing to do with the actual protagonist in the game.Given the box art, you will be quite surprised to discover that the main hero you control is actually a rather thin ninja in a red kimono.Like most games, there are several differences in the Japanese version vs the American version. Japan's \"Demon Sword\" features six more levels and several bosses not present in the US version. There are also more items and magic spells and an extended ending.  Finally, the box art for the Japan \"Demon Sword\" is much more representative of the actual hero you play in the title.Although not as in depth as the superior \"Ninja Gaiden\", released the same year, \"Demon Sword\" is worth playing through, at least once.  It is much better than \"Legend of Kage\".  \"Ninja Gaiden II\", released in 1990 and a year after this, features a similiar \"demon sword\" heavily in its plot.  The best Ninja games on the NES will always be the NES Gaiden trilogy, but a beyond that \"Demon Sword\" would be a natural choice for those looking for 8-bit ninja style gameplay (even if the ninja is wearing what looks like a red dress.  Just think of it as a kilt in Scottish tradition).The video game website IGN rated this title as the 80th greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.(For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games, you simply MUST play \"Moon Crystal\", a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive.  The graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo \"Ninja Gaiden\", amazing music, in depth gameplay, and a fantastic storyline.  Absolutely amazing!

In 1990, Acclaim Entertainment published this arcade port following the successful previous entry of the series. Like the games before it, they were changes made to enhance the game but instead, it turned to be not as good and it was the weakest of the NES games.The story went something like this: Billy and Jimmy opened up their dojo and taught many students their fighting style until one day, a mysterious group ambushed everyone. Their students were killed and Marion disappeared. Not knowing what to do, the brothers were approached by a fortune teller who told them they needed to collect sacred stones in order to get Marion and offered to guide them across the world. Like DD II, the game opens up with the choice of playing the single player mode or the two player co-op mode (followed by an additional two modes.) From here on, you must go through five stages that span the world: USA, China, Japan, Italy and Egypt. You can punch, kick, jump kick and use your special moves to fight off enemies and boss characters. Along the way, you can pick up weapons found on the ground and after beating the boss characters in China and Japan, they join you on your quest. This time around, each character in your group has one life each so when one of them dies, another person takes over until you run out of people and the game ends. Like the previous two Double Dragon games, you cannot earn extra lives and there are no passwords and no continues to use.The PROS: It looks and plays good and the music is pretty decent. There is variety when going through each stage and while you see the same enemies over and over again, the larger enemies and boss characters keep things interesting. For those of you who like a challenge, this game gives you plenty of it so prepare to work hard to beat the game.The CONS: Somehow, this game lacks the charm that the other games possessed. First off, this is based on the arcade version where the story was the same but everything else was different. The arcade version had a number based health system where in order to replenish your health, you had to feed quarters to the machine. You earned money in order to buy extra lives and additional moves for your characters (and it was the first game in the series to allow three players to play at the same time.) The NES port removed the money aspect and replaced the number health system with a traditional health meter. You couldn't earn extra lives, there are less types of weapons to use and the majority of moves from Double Dragon I and II are gone; only the cyclone spin kick and elbow blows remain. Billy and Jimmy had one new special move where you do a somersault over an enemy while grabbing his head to throw him across the screen. Meanwhile, the new characters and their special moves are average at best and don't give you an edge. If you thought the previous games were hard, think again; the brutal difficulty present in Double Dragon III is ridiculous!! The last stage alone is by the hardest in the entire game and it is the reason why I had only beaten it two times in my life!Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones turned out to be not as good as the previous entries in the series. It's too bad because the developer tried to shake it up to keep the series fun. Unfortunately, they removed a lot of what made Double Dragon II great, introduced new characters that no ones cared about and made the game too tough for most players who played it (even if they played the co-op mode.) If you still want to see why this game was not received well by gamers, check out You Tube to watch it in action before you buy the game.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not as good as the previous entries", "unixReviewTime": 1368230400, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2013"}

This is another beat-up-the-bad-guys-and-save-the-girl video game from the makers of. . . actually Technos made this game. I know next to nothing about Technos. Double Dragon is a game of three distinct trigger actions: jumping, punching, and kicking; and seeing as how the standard NES controller has only two trigger buttons, Tehcnos decided in part 3 (as with the previous games) to make jumping accessible by through pressing the both the punch and kick buttons simultaneously (there is lenience so both buttons do not need to be pressed at the exact same time). From a jump, you can perform one of three attacks as Billy or Jimmy: cyclone spin-kick (A or B), arial kick (left or right and B), or monkey-flip your opponent (left or right and A). When monkey-flipping your opponent, you somersaut over your opponent, grab his/her head or hair, and toss him/her through the air. This is especially fun when fighting on ledges -- just make sure you don't get too close and fall off, yourself.On the downside, there are no playable females (which seems to bother only myself). You can still fight against a few female thugs though.Another hex is the high level of difficulty that stems from the questionable play-control. For example, the first boss (who somehwat resembles the Jack of Hearts) has a long reach which makes him hard to hit and he often ducks when you try to whack him with your cyclone spin-kick, leaving you open for attack, thanks to a lagging recovery. You also cannot monkey-flip some enemies.As for Chin and Ranzou, these two have slightly different attack methods from the Double Dragons:Chin has a diving Kamikaze head-butt which is activated through jumping towards your an enemy and then pressing A. When your press A or B after jumping, he does some weird air dance that only attacks from one side. His weapon is the iron claw, similar to Vega from Street Fighter.Yagu Ranzou is (in my opinion) the best character. He uses a katana instead of his bare fists and he can use his other weapon 20 times (as opposed to Chin and the Lee brothers who can only use their's five). Ranzou's weapon is the shuriken (or flying ninja star).You can play as Chin and Ranzou only after you have beaten them.Billy and Jimmy's weapons are the nunchukues.Note: in case you buy this game used and without an instruction manual, you need to hold the Select button for two or three seconds during gameplay to activate the options menu for using your weapon and/or changing characters.

Double Dragon 1 was tough, but fine, Double Dragon II was just about perfect, and when we heard DDIII was about to come out, anticipation was at a high to play it.However what most of us found was a game not equal to DDI or II. I think like many at first who played this after the first 2, wondered why the heck the game was so hard and lacked options to make it easier. Both the original games started off on the street, this one starts in  a Dojo... okay, maybe they wanted to try something new, but it seemed to be wrong from the start. Straight away you start off against 1 opponent, once you beat them you have to go talk to a friend dieing on the side of the screen who tells you he tried to stop the new bad guys, but he couldn't, and the main person to beat is... that's what it says, \"is...\" leaving it like a mystery as he dies. I guess that would be fine, but it's the way its shown... DD1 has a cut scene of Marian being kidnapped before you play, DDII explains it in the intro that you can skip, but in DDIII you have to wait a few seconds for this on screen dialog/talk to hurry up and finish before you can resume, and that is just an annoying step backwards.Next up you find your moves you got used to from DDI or DDII are again something different. I used to think the only way to improve DDII would be to have included the ground punches and head-butt moves back into the game. Now DDIII has a few familiar moves, but lacks in them. In Double Dragon II you relied a lot on your jumping 360 kick that you could preform from the jumping up or down, or jumping to the left and right, in Double Dragon III you can only perform it by jumping up and down, you can not execute the move jumping in either direction, which is a shame. Also needed was the return of the jumping-power-knee and super-uppercuts from DDII, but they are sorely missed in DDIII... even the reverse elbow smash from DDI would have been a nice addition.So what has been added to the 3rd one, move wise? Apart from regular kicks and punches, the only returning move is the jumping 360 kick, which you can not do jumping left or right now. A run feature has been included and a move where you can jump and flip over your opponent, grab their hair and throw them across the screen... you can also now do a move where if you run at a wall, you can bounce off the wall with a super flying kick, which is a decent move if you can do it.. and there is also a couple of double-team moves for 2 players; one is a flying kick your partner helps throw you in, and the other is a joined hand dancing spin kick fest that is probably the best move in the game, but can only be done in 2 player mode... Double Dragon 3 really had lacked in quality from the other Double Dragon games as being a great game on 2 player, or single play.It almost seems like this game was being designed, and new ideas where just not working; so instead of scrapping the game or improving what flaws it had to be a great game, they released a demo and forgot to tell people to send in their thoughts to help improve the game. Even in the 2 player intro screens, the game says the two heroes are Billy & Bimmy Lee... Bimmy? A spelling error like that in a NES game? Or maybe it is correct, maybe Jimmy Lee refused to be in this sarky game,  so ACCLAME asked their retarded cousin Bimmy to be in it instead? The other thing that bugs me is your enemies are not supposed to be Shadow Warriors from the previous Double Dragons... then why does Linda, Williams and whatever other enemies make a return?What makes this game harder from the previous DD games is the lack of options, there simply isn't any. You can make the game even harder by selecting 2 player B and beating up player two so you can solo play against twice as many enemies... but if you wanna make the game easier, you will need a pro-action-replay or something to help you cheat.The biggest issue with this version is extra lives... there isn't any! You get 1 life... you die, you're out! Do not pass go, do not collect 2up hundred dollars... nope, you're screwed. If you can manage to beat two other character in the game, some slow and fat ninja guy and a samurai, these guys will become your extra life. You can choose to select these guys by pressing select and choosing them to take over, or if you die as who you are in the game, one of these guys will take over as your main character... what I do not get is why the heck couldn't Jimmy be selectable in a 1 player game as your back up life? There is a little trick you can do to make that so, what you do is start the game on 2 player B and beat up Jimmy, or should I say, the retarded cousin of the Lee brothers, Bimmy, who accidentally misspells his own name on the game-play screen as Jimmy. Anyway, beat the first baddie, then beat up JimmBimm until your next hit will be the one that kills him. Then position him sort of in the middle of the room in a way that when you perform your jumping spinning 360 kick, he lands on the guy you have to talk to. If done right, Jimmy will activate him talking to you guys, instead of dieing. Then, make sure BillyBobJim doesn't die during the battle with the next few bad guys. Once the Dojo enemies are gone, have Jimmy exit the room first, then Billy. When you emerge from the room on the street, Jimmy will be gone, but if you press select, Jimmy is there as your 2nd option of character and your backup life.... however, don't use Jimmy till you have reached level two, as he will still have the ready to die energy he had from your beating until it regenerates in level two.Now, as I was saying about the extra guys you can choose. They are useless, what moron thought it would be a good idea to allow you to use two extra characters that are just about useless? As boss enemies, they are decent, but to play as them is pretty weak, especially if you lose Billy/BimpDaddyJimbo and are stuck playing the rest of the game as one of these losers... as I did, getting stuck with the Samurai guy to finish the game off and yet somehow the dead Jimmy still gets the glory in the end.So, I haven't said many positive things about the game yet... one option I do like is your option to swap characters during game play and have a special weapon you can choose to use at any time... however, unless you know how to rom hack like I did and add Jimmy as your second character by default play, and also have unlimited use of the special weapons... not to mention invincibility... then they are more something you have to plan and use strategies for when you are going to use them and how. Using cheats like that was the only way I could beat this game. Maybe you are good enough to do it without using any methods of cheats... but being someone who can beat Double Dragon II with my eyes closed and then coming into DDIII like someone who dies on the first goomba of Mario Bros, it really pi..cheesed... me off.Once game play was over and done with, I was not impressed one little bit with the ending of the game. At least the first II Double Dragons showed something that made you feel like you had passed the game.. but this ones text \"where are they now\" screens really do show the lack of thought and imagination put into this game ..\"Billy & BJimmy rode off into the sunset to teach Kung Fu, while FuMan Chu and Tom Cruise become emperors of Kmart discounts\" what kind of ending is that? No scenes, no decent ending, just a \"what happened to them, bye\" screen. I hate these games that are so hard to beat, and reward you with nothing once it's over. I suppose it's not quite nothing, nothing would be a single screen with no pictures saying, \"thanks for playing, sorry you wasted so much time to see this text, bye\". But this game here may as well have said just that.So I guess that's why I don't particularly like DDIII. Not on the NES anyway... least the Arcade version was pretty decent and even allowed a 3rd player... but most importantly, had extra lives for as long as you could drop coins into it. And you know what the worse thing about it is? It's one of those rare times when you can truly say, even the Sega had a better version the NES. Sure the nes version isnt as bad as the GameGear version, but it's sad when even the GameBoy has a better version then the NES.I think with the lack of effort put into the game, and it's terrible reward for beating the game, that is why it is so hard. The game makers don't want you to be able to beat it, so you can see just how unrewarding it is. At last moment before they decided to release it, like I was saying before about it being a demo... I really think game testers where thinking that the game is so bad, give people 1 life so they can't advance to the end and see just how sh/badly we have made this version, but because DDI & II sold so well, this one is guaranteed to make us a few bucks anyway, so just release it as it is now, no one will see the end of it anyway.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "The worst of the NES trilogy.", "unixReviewTime": 1278547200, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2010"}

When you ask somebody what the low point of the series was, they may tell you Double Dragon V or the Double Dragon Neo Geo game, but I think the series hit rock bottom with this Game Boy conversion of the third arcade game. The weak graphics and sound can be excused but the gameplay is the absolute pits and ruins the entire game.The graphics are below average even for the black and white Gameboy. The characters are very small and undistinguishable. There are some nice cinema like scenes here and there to spice things up and some of the backgrounds are decent but otherwise a disappointment. Whether or not you want to admit it, there are some classic Double Dragon tunes, for instance the Gameboy, NES and arcade adaptations of the first game anyway (no bias here, I just have never played the Sega or Atari ports, so sue me). This game has none of them, the music is very drab and the same sort of tinny beat seems to be recycled throughout all of the levels. The feel of the music also doesn't go with the game, it doesn't sound like it matches the action or levels. The sound effects are not much better. The gameplay is where this cart really suffers. The enemies are frustratingly hard and move very fast. Even the weakest foes can move, punch and kick much faster than your character. It is difficult to actually hit an enemy and if you do, they can strike back so fast that they inevitably nail you a few times before you can hit them again. For every hit you administer on any enemy, they often get at least one hit on you, if not more, in return. As expected, at any given point SEVERAL enemies are working your fighter at once and won't let up. The bosses and stronger enemies leave your character even more over matched. One particularly tough boss crushes your hopes and dreams in an instant as he splits into two fighters just when you think you have put him down for the count. Your jump kick and new 'wall kick' are even less successful and hit the enemy only about one third of the time you attempt it. This game has a coin system in which you can purchase extra lives, an energy restoration, special moves (the same spin kick that you could do for free in earlier games) and weapons (which you also got for free in earlier games). The special moves and weapons don't make your fight any easier, the enemies are still too hard. Don't waste your coins on them. You're better off just buying extra lives whenever possible (you are only allowed to buy so many), you're going to need them. It is almost impossible to make it out of any level, even the first one, without losing at least one life. It is even toughter to knock the motorcycle riders in this game off of their bikes than it is in the two NES Renegade games, if that is possible. You start with a select number of coins and can spend them as you see fit throughout the game. This game can be beaten, I have done it once (without the Game Genie no less). If you do want to see the end, there are some Game Genie codes that will enable this, it's the only sure way to make it all the way through. Here you go. Since many of you may choose not to answer the challenge, I'll throw you a bone as to what happens later on in the game. Your &quot;travel guide&quot; later turns on you and attacks you out of the blue near the end of one of the later levels. On the bright side, the story line is a fresh change of pace from the usual affair of rescuing Marian. In this game, you must locate magical Rosetta stones before the &quot;bad guys&quot; do. I did not notice any of the enemies from the earlier games but I did hear that the blurry, unrecognizable boss from level 2 or 3 just MIGHT be Chintai from the original Double Dragon game. If the enemies weren't so cheap and utterly impossible, this game would have gotten a better score, despite the poor sounds and graphics. A game doesn't need super graphics and sounds to be exceptional, but it certainly needs fair game play. I wanted to like this game and am a big fan of the DD series. I can not recommend it, though. If you're desperate for a side-scrolling fighter for Gameboy, take a chance but beware! Personally, I would tell you to try one of the other Double Dragon games (the first one was a good translation, comparable to the NES version) on the console or get a Gameboy Advance and check out Final Fight One. For those of you who frown upon the use of the Game Genie but are still stuck, I offer some tips as this game is very hard/unfair. In levels where you find a store close to some enemies (start of level 1, for instance), fight as many as you can until you run low on energy or defeat them all and then head into the store and buy an energy booster. When you have the chance, always buy extra lives. If you can't do that, go for the energy restoration. If you can't have either of those two, you can get a weapon (it's your best attack, only because it is presumably the strongest) or consider saving your coins for a later level as there may be another store with extra lives/energy.

With those new companies, you can get all the cheats for the games and supe up your teams to be unbeatable. That's not the case with old Konami games.Take Double Dribble for example. It is in my opinion the best Basketball video game of all time. Sure there are only 4 teams, but they are all equal in stature and prominence. Choose from the Frogs, Falcons, Wave, or Bulls, and it won't matter who you play against because there are no '96 Bulls vs. '01 Bulls that create a complete mismatch. The game play is very responsive, and it's easy to get the hang of it. I love how realistic this game is because your players DO NOT make every single shot like it's NBA Jam or anything. You have to work to get open and shoot intelligent shots (No behind the back 3-pointers).Now some people may not like the graphics just because it's old, but who cares about graphics when you're playing a fun game. There's not much to a basketball video game than a court, 2 baskets, 10 players, and a ball. You don't need rendered facial expressions or a realistic crowd and arena.

It's a fast paced, back and forth game where you can really pile on the points. And believe it or not defense is a huge factor in this game. Go for the quick steal or block the shot to make up any deficit. This was the first basketball game I remember playing over and over again. Play 4 quarters of basketball. Quarters range from 5mins to a half hour! That's right you could possibly score up to 300 points in this game. The regular rules of the NBA apply here. It's a  5 on 5 game and you can shoot 3 pointers and dunk. The only difference in the rules are offensive fouls. If committed the other team gets to shoot free throws. I found this a little annoying because I kept committing them and almost gave up the lead. Even though it's not NBA licensed the game does feature NBA knock off teams. Seeing how it's an arcade style game and the players are nameless and faceless it doesn't bother me that theres only 5 teams. However in 1 player mode you can't use the Boston Frogs.

If you liked the first two titles you will love the third one.Although somewhat primitive by today's standards, \"Dragon Warrior III\" suffers from much of the same problems as other massively influential titles: innovative features first introduced here have become so commonplace in subsequent titles and also better handled that playing through the older titles now feels like going backwards.The sound and graphics are to be expected for an early title.  Be aware though the graphic tileset is lifted from the original Dragon Warrior. The dungeons are rather drab, and to get your initial weapons require quite a bit of gold.  Still, the experience of the game is very deep and entertaining.For example, Dragon Warrior III introduces us to the concept of the multi-party.  Although Dragon Warrior II features two extra companions you can take, Dragon Warrior III takes that one step further, with three different party members you can select, each one customisable with seven different classes you can choose from. There was now a real element of stragety on who you selected, with fighters, healers, etc.All of this is very standard in today's RPGs, but back in the late 1980s this was revolutionary.  The Dragon Warrior games really set the template (along with FINAL FANTASY and PHANTASY STAR) that RPGs have followed ever since.Chronologically, the events of \"Dragon Warrior III\" occur before \"Dragon Warrior\".  \"Dragon Warrior\" and \"Dragon Warrior II\" are set in the same world. In \"Dragon Warrior III\", the game is set many years before the first two titles and in a separate world. The main villain of \"Dragon Warrior III\" is Baramos. The hero (who the player can make either male or female\" is summoned by the king to fight Baramos.After embarking on the quest, eventually the Hero and his cast of friends will defeat Baramoss. It turns out Zoma is the main villain behind Baromas, and throws the Hero and his or her party into the Dark World. The Dark World is actually Alefgard which is where the first two titles are set. Then the hero must recover several items from the original \"Dragon Warrior\" in order to create the Rainbow Bridge so they can go to Zoma's castle for the final confrontation.\"Dragon Warrior III\" also used a Class system, unlike the original \"Dragon Warrior\" title. Also, the gender does of the character does have some game play effects, such as dialogue changes and the fact only certain items are available to either male or female characters who are the hero, though these changes are not drastic.There is a famous urban myth that the Japan government outlawed the release of \"Dragon Quest\" games during school days because of how they disrupted students' academic pursuits, although in actually Enix made the decision to release \"Dragon Quest\" games on the weekend.In 2006 the game magazing Famitsu conducted a survey of readers' favorite titles of all time. \"Dragon Quest III\" placed third, behind \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Final Fantasy VII\".For an NES title, the game is very large, and although grinding is involved and the game is overall difficult, for those who love turn based RPGs and don't mind the graphics, they will find a deeply rewarding title here.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fantastic RPG and very large", "unixReviewTime": 1325980800, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2012"}

It has two detailed worlds to explore; multiple sidequests; an army of distinct playable classes; and an array of dungeons, towers, caves, and castles to explore.  Several new features are also introduced, including the ability to create hybrid classes by using a class change; the ability to fly (and not just sail); unique magic spells allowing you to transform into other characters, ironize so you can see new enemies' attack patterns, and instant death spells; and a vault where you can deposit your hard-earned cash and items for safekeeping.The game's controls are greatly improved over those of its predecessors.  The key system was improved so that each new key opens all doors that previous keys could open (thus making it unnecessary to hold 3 or 4 different keys that could only open one type of door).  The Return spell was also greatly improved, thus allowing you to travel around the world far more easily.  Navigating the menus is also a bit easier.Dragon Warrior III is a long quest.  The different classes you can select greatly increase its replay value and affect the game's difficulty.  The class change feature, available to all characters (except the hero) after level 20, allows you to customize your team even further.  For example, you could create soldiers that know how to heal or a pilgrim/white mage that can use black magic.  Different team configurations call for different strategies regarding fighting bosses and getting through dungeons--all things that increase Dragon Warrior III's replay value.Another clever innovation was the introduction of the passage of time.  Enemies are more active and more deadly during the nighttime.  Sometimes a town may take on a different persona at night.  And other times, nighttime is the only time when you can gather some important clues.  The day/night component of this game only makes the exploring aspect of it more fun.However, like all games, Dragon Warrior III has a few demerits.  For one, the beginning of the game starts off a bit too slowly because the weapons and armor you need to buy to survive are very expensive, considering how much gold you win from the enemies after each battle.  So this will require a bit of time-consuming leveling up or betting at the fighting ring (another innovation), particularly when you reach Romaly, Kanave, and Isis.Another weakness is its graphics.  While Dragon Quest historically is not known for graphical brilliance, the graphics in this game are almost completely unchanged from its first two games.  This game was released at about the same time as Final Fantasy 1 (or maybe even a year later), but its tile-based graphics are much poorer.  The dungeons also look repetitious (green walls with gray floors, or brown walls with dark brown floors).Also, the music score in this game is generally uninspiring.  There are a few catchy tunes and a nice remake of the original Dragon Warrior music, but for the most part, the sound is disappointing.  You may have more fun if you just put the game's sound on mute and listen to your favorite CD while you play instead.As for the game's difficulty, it really depends on what kinds of warriors you chose and how you developed them.  A team with only one magic-user will probably struggle just as much as a team with three magic users.  There's even a goofoff class that, well, goofs off during battle.  The game's overall difficulty is a bit easier than in Dragon Warrior II, but it is still more difficult than average.  The bosses are plentiful, and some of them will give you a real headache.  Some enemies can attack you twice, while others can inflict a variety of status-changing ailments.  Others are just downright deadly (Evil Mages and Salamanders, for example).  So you have to stay alert.  The game's difficulty also ramps up considerably once you reach Samanao (2/3 of the way through the game).  You will likely spend lots of time leveling up just to keep pace with the enemies you will face towards the end of the game.All in all, Dragon Warrior III is a very solid game.  Most of its weaknesses are technical and aesthetic.  However, the storyline itself is very good and its execution is crisp.  Again, Dragon Warrior III is a long game filled with places to explore.  It has also aged quite well throughout the years and is an essential part of any NES RPG library.  This game is probably very difficult to find, so expect to pay a high price for it.  It's not that the game is super rare, but rather that the people who bought it don't want to sell it (and rightfully so, as it's a very good game).  Having said that, unless you are insistent on playing the NES version of this game, you would be better off buying the enhanced remake of it for the Game Boy Advance or the Super Famicom (if you can read Japanese) instead.  Only serious collectors would probably be interested in paying lots of money for the NES version of this game, as the remakes would give the casual gamer far more for your money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the 3 best RPGs on the NES", "unixReviewTime": 1141776000, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2006"}

The storyline consists of five chapters, eight characters, a small gang of playable auxiliary characters (that have a personality), and a ton of places to visit and explore.The first four chapters of the game serve as a prelude to the final, main chapter.  In the first four chapters, you are introduced to the supporting characters in the game as they tackle subquest after subquest without being aware of their larger purpose of restoring peace and serenity to the world.  This part of the game can go a bit slowly because you have to literally level up four different parties, which means fighting lots of basic enemies like Slimes and Kaskos Hoppers and Giant Worms.  However, the storylines make sense and there are some tough dungeons to contend with.The fifth and final chapter introduces the hero and starts off with a bang.  You then spend the rest of the game locating the supporting characters, finding the legendary weapons, and putting an end to Necrosaro and his evil designs.  This quest is very long and involves lots of subquests and plot twists.  The game's difficulty ramps up considerably in this chapter and you'll have a lot of tough fights.Technically speaking, the graphics are only a slight improvement compared to the previous games in the series, but they are a bit brighter and more colorful.  The enemies are well-drawn and the dungeons are expansive.  The sound effects are adequate and the music does a good job of matching the situation.  The ship music in particular is good.My biggest complaint with this game is the tactics system in Chapter 5.  This system makes it impossible to directly control the supporting members of your team, which means they have to rely on the computer's AI while only being \"guided\" by the tactic you select.  Only being able to directly control the hero makes for some rather frustrating battles, particularly with boss-type foes.  It is not fun to be fighting the master archfiend and then watching one of your wizards waste a turn by deciding to try and put him to sleep instead of healing a wounded teammate.However, the sheer size of the game, the complexity of the storyline, and the special features it offers (collecting the small medals, the casino in Endor), more than make up for this.  This game is probably too rare to find at a flea market, but if you are able to purchase it somewhere, it would be a worthy addition to your RPG library.

I played it a LOT, and I got to know it inside out (although that may have been at least partly because of Nintendo Power magazine...). I also beat it, I think, many times. I had a lot of fun with the game. It was really cool to be able to play the role of the richest duck in the world as he traveled around the world (and to the moon!) searching for treasures. The ability to use Scrooge's cane as a pogo stick to hop on and defeat enemies (and open boxes to get items), make it over spikes (and stuff like that), or just to generally get around, and the ability to use it to whack objects into enemies (and to reveal hidden items) are awesome! In addition to the treasures which are the main objects that you're going after, there are other items that you can get to help you out. The diamonds, of course, add to your money (which you have instead of \"points\"), ice cream and cake restore lost health, and duck dolls give you an extra life. There are also a few other things to get, including a couple of items that make your energy meter longer. I think it's cool that you don't have to take the stages in any particular order. (The snow stage presents a \"special\" kind of challenge, because you can't pogo in the snow!) The game has many hidden areas, which is neat. To get to them, or to many of them anyway, requires you walk across the top of the screen, which is something that I think was pioneered by Super Mario Bros.!

{"reviewerID": "A1PASRZ81DY9C", "asin": "B00004SVPL", "reviewerName": "Austin Somlo", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "6/11: If you were to conduct a survey and try to find out the top ten hardest NES games, you will invariably see Fester's Quest in there. Yes, its reputation for being notoriously difficult to play is much richly deserved. Some have said that it is a straight rip-off from another game made by Sunsoft called Master Blaster. Quite frankly, I just don't see it. Fester's Quest is in a class of its own for different reasons. I am not going to say that it is a good game to play because it is not. For most part, I feel the difficulty of the game is attributed to bad programming. One thing is for sure: there are no passwords, making it a very arduous and draining game to play because once Fester dies, he will have to start all over again from square one. He can be hit by anyone, and it only takes two hit points to die. The maximum is four, if two health bars are found, which is nearly not enough. At least, the programmers had the decency not to take away my inventory and also force me to go through the bosses all over again (thank you...because if that is going to be the case, I guarantee you that Fester's Quest deserves the number one or two spot for being the hardest NES game ever made). Two, the problem with gun upgrades, it's impossible to go from level 8 to 7 (or 6, 5) and then back to 8. So, what do you do when this happens? You need to downgrade (yes...purposely downgrade) the level of the gun to level 4 before rebuilding it back up because you won't see a blue gun upgrade ever again in the game until you do this method. It takes a good ten to fifteen minutes of killing off the spawned green balls in areas 1 to 5 or green crowns in the spaceship area to pick up the downgrades and upgrades. So, it is absolutely imperative that once you have level 8 gun and level 4 whip, do not ever touch the red ones in the entire game; do not even think about going crazy with the whip. Most of my time playing Fester's Quest was wasted due to restarts, walking from square one to back to where I died (I must have done it like dozens times including going from square one to the spaceship about five times), and gun downgrade snafu. Ok, I am going to give some strategies in each area and how to beat it as I beat Fester's Quest without a game genie which took me roughly 9 hours to accomplish in one sitting with a normal NES controller. Yes, the game takes a great deal of concentration and energy out of you. That's why it is one of the hardest games in NES history.Area 1: A word of warning, you may notice that Fester, if he is hit, will walk extremely slow. A lot of players is misunderstood, after the moment it happens, that's how the entire game will be like, and then they will proceed to turn off the power. To solve the problem, you need to go to menu and select Vice Grips and then press A in the game to enable it. Now, Fester can move fast. If you have no Vice Grips from beginning, it's best to restart it and make sure to never get hit again until you reach the second house where Wednesday is in to get them. Anyway, to start the game off, it's imperative to build your gun up to level 8 before going to first boss. The whip (an extremely important item to have) won't come until Area 2. I just find Area 1 very straightforward. The Area Boss is pretty easy to defeat if you move around it in circles and setting off the TNTs as it goes from left to right and vice versa while avoiding the whips. You will find yourself going through Area 1 all the time, so make a habit of going to every house to pick up the TNTs, Vice Grips, Potions, and Invisibility.Area 2: Make sure to pick up the whip and start upping it to level 4. Now, a word of warning: DO NOT GO CRAZY WITH IT. Just take your time with it, and if in doubt, use the gun very often. Otherwise, be prepared to farm for gun downgrades and then upgrades for a good ten to fifteen minutes. Of all bosses, Area 2 Boss is the toughest. So how to beat it: when the Boss throws the whip on one side, get over to there immediately and use the missiles until it's gone. For example, if you are moving to left side and the Boss throws a whip on the opposite of your direction, immediately turn around until you are where the whip was previously thrown. Then, use level 4 whip and whip the Boss. It will take a good twenty or so hits to beat it (not an easy task). Use your instincts to when to use the Invisibility, and go to the Boss and whip it as fast as you can before giving up to avoid any hits. When you are low in health (preferably one hit point left), use Potions.Area 3: Make a habit of picking up the Missiles every time. The Knight Boss is easier this time. He is just too slow, so use the missiles and move around a lot. When you are all out of missiles, use the level 4 whip and Invisibility. When you are low in health (preferably one hit point left), use Potions.Area 4: Thankfully, the shortest area of the game. The Boss is easy as well. Just watch his jump before he begins to shoot three bullets in a predictable angular fashion. So, just get in between the gaps and use the missiles. Make sure to move from left to right and vice versa in a small segment of path. There is no reason to go all the way to one side and also the other side. When you are all out of missiles, use the level 4 whip and Invisibility. When you are low in health (preferably one hit point left), use Potions.Area 5: Finally, we get Nooses, arguably the best item of the game, but sadly, it's not allowed in fights with Bosses. You may use all Nooses as you like prior to fight with next Boss, but when you have defeated all of the Bosses and have to start all over again by walking from square one to Spaceship, don't ever use any of the Nooses. In fact, don't ever waste any Missile, Potion (one is okay, but that's it), and Invisibility until you get inside the spaceship. Once inside, it is okay to use Potions, but nothing else. I demand you to have at least 3 Potions, exactly 5 Invisibility, and exactly 20 Missiles during the Final Boss of Spaceship Area. You must have 15 Nooses inside of Spaceship Area, no exceptions. If you feel that you are in a serious shortage of any, well...all I can say is: Good Luck and enjoy your walking all over again. The Boss is easy because it's the same as before yet with an additional feature. Like before, find your gaps and use missiles when ready. Just keep walking left to right and vice versa. When you are all out of missiles, use the level 4 whip and Invisibility. When you are low in health (preferably one hit point left), use Potions.Spaceship: Be absolutely sure to have gun at level 8 and whip at level 4. The whip is more important than the gun anyway. If you find yours low in any, it's fine. Just go to the hallway where you see the green crowns and use the gun to farm them all until you are properly geared. A word of advice: I do not recommend ever using the Nooses on the Eyeballs. You can easily kill them with level 4 whip. Just time it perfectly to get them as soon as it lands. Don't even think about using the gun on them either because you will get them all mad and they will all come at you mad hopping. The only times you will use the Noose are when you see the big monsters with flying arms, the wheelie bugs with bright green mass in center, and the huge green robots. Going from start to finish in Spaceship Area, there is enough of Nooses to take care of them all with probably two to three leftover. So, it's pretty easy actually.Final Boss: Probably the easiest of all Bosses, as soon as the fight begins, use the Invisibility and start whipping (level 4 is a must) at the machine gun box as fast as you can until it dies. Every time your invisibility runs out, keep using another and use Potion as soon as you have one hit point left. Move over to the other machine gun box to take it out in the same way as before. When both boxes finally are destroyed, walk to the farthest right side. Now, you are completely 100% safe from being hit. Now, time to use all of the missiles. Notice that the targets will be on two boxes and the center mass of the organism. Switch around the target until it's at the center mass, and unleash it. You will beat the game when you take your time with the missiles. Like I said before, it's very imperative to have 5 Invisibility and at least 3 Potions to beat this Boss.The ending is garbage, but the game is garbage anyway.

Even at that, I still find Fester's Quest to utilize this style of gameplay in a decent way. You must walk around town and save the town from aliens. By using a gun (and later on, a whip), you can kill enemies to pick up the appropriate items that can be used with the A button. There are bulbs that have to be used every time you enter the sewers, keys to gain more items from noteworthy Addams Family members and enter buildings in a primitive first person perspective, potions to restore health (which I guarantee you will need multiple times), vice grips to regain your speed if stung by a bee that makes you move slow, and that's just a sample from the first area.The guns are rather flawed. There's the obvious upgrade that can make your gun stronger and have a wider projectile range, but a flaw to some of the gun patterns include shots being blocked by the walls, and shots bypassing the enemies. The major issue with the gun is that it is constant tapping with the B button, which means that a controller with a turbo button would be a far more suitable option in this case. Also, the guns are capable of downgrading, and it's going to be necessary at times when progressing throughout the game.Another flaw with this game is the unfair life meter and continue options. Fester starts off with two blocks of health, which can get up to four, and it's going to be necessary to save up the potions in the games for the bosses. With the flaws of the gun and the sluggish pace that can affect Fester's movement, it's inevitable that you might die the first couple of attempts in this game. There is not even a password feature, let alone a save option a la The Legend of Zelda. Instead, there is a continue option, but it starts you back at the beginning of the game. The fortunate part is that you keep all of your items and power ups accumulated from the last session, so that's a plus.If there's anything that I actually admire in this game, it would be the sound spectrum. Because Sunsoft developed this game, the music is excellent, memorable and suits the game perfectly (not to mention we get to hear the familiar Addam's Family jingle in the title screen as well). Also, the graphic spectrum is rather good for a console of its time, especially in the boss battles and menu screen. The gameplay itself isn't really that bad despite the aforementioned flaws. It's rewarding to see the accomplishments made by entering new sections of the game, even if it must be done multiple times, but overall, this game is a passable addition to the NES catalog. Just make sure that you have a lot of free time, patience, and a turbo controller if needed.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Decent but frustrating (and sometimes unfair)", "unixReviewTime": 1326067200, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2012"}

Or at least they'd take some crappy game and slap a name on it, because this clearly has no ties to the world of The Adams Family beyond the title.But let's put the story flaws aside and focus on the fact that the game is impossible to play. Fester only gets two life bars, which go fast when his laser gun (he has a laser gun) proves relatively ineffective on the aliens. You can shoot the non-moving ones four or five times to get an item, but even with upgrades I was unable to kill the jumping aliens (which look suspiciously like the Legend of Zelda jumping creatures). Each venture into the world lasted a minute or two, and once you die the game is over and you start again.Pressing pause only brings up further questions. You can select between a gun and a whip for a weapon, but I couldn't figure out how to change it. There are various items you can collect, including keys and money, but I never got anywhere that they could be used.As far as I can tell, this game is impossible to play... forget about playing through to the end, because even surviving five minutes seems like a grand achievement.

{"reviewerID": "A1PASRZ81DY9C", "asin": "B00004SVPT", "reviewerName": "Austin Somlo", "helpful": [6, 7], "reviewText": "Despite its disreputation for being one of the worst NES games made and also for the fact that it was made by LJN company, Friday the 13th is actually and surprisingly a good game. It wasn't more of a beat `em up one but rather a very deeply strategic game. I had to change my strategies many times during Day One, then Day Two and going back to Day One, and finally Day Three and back. I was trying to figure out the best way to approach Jason in each day given his increasingly super strength abilities. Eventually, I beat the game although I found it pretty annoying a lot of times. However, it is an ingeniously made game. Now, I am going to show you how to beat Friday the 13th as painlessly as possible. First of all, I forewarn you that the learning curve for this game is somewhat steep, but anyone who has played Mission: Impossible on NES will undoubtedly be familiar with the basic idea of Friday the 13th. Now, I strongly recommend to you to spend a couple of hours navigating through the trails and be familiar with the basic idea of switching around counselors and passing on weapons. This is the most important aspect of the game. You cannot win without mastering this part first.Day 1: I read in a lot of strategy guides that every character ought to be equipped with a dagger. Forget that...that's rubbish. What you should do right now, make a map exactly what you see on the screen. Draw the trails, the houses, and whatever pertinent. Then, start killing the zombies and jumping over and over, especially through the trees. Anytime you see an item revealed, use a color code on the map you drew standing for something (i.e., pink for medicine, green for dagger, brown for key, and yellow for a lighter). Keep doing this as often as you can throughout the map. Now, about the forests, the bottom part, I never went to there and don't find it worth going there because it's too easy to get lost in there. However, the top forest, entering from the bottom, is quite important to master. There are goodies on the left side. Now, to reach the cabin inside of that forest is to go right as you entered from the bottom, push up as soon as you see a trail and then push up again to be inside of the cabin. This is a very, very important cabin. To get out of the forest is to get out of the cabin, go right, down as you see a trail, go right again, and then down again. Again, I stress the fact that this cabin is the most important of the game. As for the cave, you should always use Mark because of his awesome jumping ability. Go left, jump over the two gaps, and then push up just before the third gap. Now, this is another important cabin to be in because killing Jason's mother will give you two invaluable items necessary to win the game. Okay, we've covered the basic elements. Time to restart the game clean. Despite the strategy guide telling you that you should have Mark on the top left cabin around the lake, I don't find it all that necessary, but you should start with Mark first wherever he is. Now, Mark should kill three to four zombies and get a lighter. Then find the dagger and the key as you referenced their positions in the map you made. Now, go to the big cabin on the trail around the lake and which is right between the two big forests. Push Up and then turn right. There is a message that says, \"GO INTO THE WOODS.\" Now, get out of the cabin and go into the forest from the bottom and find the cabin. Once in there, leave the cabin and come back to it again. Once inside there, turn left and get the message, \"FIRE WILL DAMAGE JASON THE MOST.\" Now, leave the cabin and before the door, the machete should appear. Pick it up. Get out of the woods. Find a character (not Chrissy) that you can pass the machete down to. Go back to the same house where you got the first message. Push Up, Up, turn around, and Up. Finally, you got the blow torch. Go to the same character that you passed the machete down to and switch weapons. Mark should go to the cave where he will fight Jason's mother. Be sure to have Mark to collect as many medicine bottles as possible (at least six will be good). Kill the mother and you receive a blow torch for free. Now, you have two characters with a torch. Switch to Chrissy and do the same exact thing all over again (get the dagger, key, lighter, Woods message, and then Fire message). If Chrissy is able to get the machete (sometimes, it's there, and sometimes, it's not). If she got the machete, pass it to a character who doesn't have it. Then, Chrissy will go back to the same cabin on the trail to pick up a blow torch. Now you got three characters with a blow torch and one character with a machete. Do this one more time with another character. Eventually, you should have four characters with a blow torch and either one or two with a machete. Make sure that you take your time on Day One, collecting the required items, and most important of all, do not allow any of the characters to pick up an item s/he has already possessed. For example, if Mark has a dagger, do not pick up another one; reserve that for a different character who doesn't have it yet. Ditto for other items. The hardest to find is the key. Also, make sure that Mark has enough medicine potions, and the rest should be picked up by Chrissy. Those two are the most important characters of the game. Treat George as the first expendable character, and he should possess the worst weapon (dagger or rock) available. If you are lucky enough to find all machetes and torches, then George should have the machete. Every bit of damaging hits on Jason helps a lot. Now, when you have equipped every character as possible, go and defeat Jason while having at least five characters alive for the second day. It's not hard to defeat Jason on Day One with all of the six characters alive. Fighting Jason in the cabin is like playing Mike Tyson's Punch Out!! all over again. Same strategy over and over...Jason makes a left side and comes to you. You dodge left, he pulls back, and you throw the weapon at him twice. Repeat. Sometimes, Jason does the two hit movement. Eventually, you'll get used to it. Sometimes, when Jason alarm goes off and it turns out to be a counselor, it is a very good idea to find the nearest small cabin and push START and switch to the counselor being in the same cabin as Jason. Then, you get out of the cabin ASAP and you fight Jason on the trail and keep following him as much as possible. This strategy should be heavily used the entire game. It is worse when Jason alarm goes off, and the children are being attacked. You have to go to the cabins in the middle of the lake and take some hits from flying zombies, a crow, and/or occasional floating Jason. I hate going to there, especially on Day Three.Day Two: After you have defeated Jason on Day One, start as Mark first, and switch his weapon with another character who has the machete. With Mark, go to the cave again and fight Jason's mother one more time. Defeat her, and you will receive an all-important flashing sweater. This is the most important item needed to finally defeat Jason in Day Three. Make sure to switch weapons for Mark, so he can have the blow torch back. Now, pretty much after that, same strategy as before, and go defeat Jason. It is not as hard as the other day, and it feels like Mike Tyson's Punch Out!! (more like facing Piston Honda twice) again. Be sure to learn his moves as he will make a rapid double hit movement where you need to make a rapid two dodge movement.Day Three: After you have defeated Jason on Day Two, this is the last one. What I am going to say is: NEVER EVER GO TO ANY OF THE CABINS AND TRY TO TAKE ON JASON. YOU WILL NOT WIN PERIOD! ANYBODY WHO SAYS THAT HE CAN TAKE ON JASON IN THERE IS 100% PURE LIAR. But, one time, you will have to use Mark to take on Jason in the cabin in the middle of the lake. Ok...to start off the day, pick Mark again, and make him to go right in the center of the opening to the lake on the left side. Stay there at all times, do not move to anywhere. Keep killing the zombies to pass the time. Jason should come after you, or Jason will attack a counselor. Whenever either happens, attack him on trail or go to the nearest small house and switch counselors (then leave the cabin ASAP) and start fighting with Jason on trail. Switch back to Mark and go back to the same original position. When Jason alarm begins again (more likely, he will attack the children), go to the middle of the lake and take on Jason. This time, do not dodge anymore. Attack him rapidly as you can with the blow torch. Hit him, hit him, hit him...as hard as you and as fast as you can. You will win, and then get out of the cabin, and go to the right side. Finally, you will take on Jason on the trail and defeat him for good.During the entire time, make sure to attend to Jason alarm; it is okay to sacrifice some children if you don't feel like going to the middle of the lake. But always be sure to attack him whenever one of the counselors is being threatened. It's your best time to expose Jason's weakness. Be sure to always use the character with the most health points as possible to take on Jason. Whoever has very low health points should be avoided until the next day where everybody is automatically given full health points.My strategy is the best and perfectly refined right now, although it will take time to accomplish the goals required. The point of the machetes and the blow torches for nearly all of the characters is due to pretty good damage points they inflict on Jason. A rock (please...this is the most worthless weapon in NES history) or a dagger on Jason is not going to do a damn thing. Every blow on Jason inflicted by a machete or a blow torch wielded by all of the counselors counts and will save you for good. The flashing sweater will significantly reduce the damage dealt by Jason, and it is the most important item to have. Finally, Mark should have the most medicine bottles because he is the most important counselor and the only one (I haven't tested Chrissy much, but I think she can also do it) who can handle Jason's worst. Whatever you do, DO NOT FIGHT JASON IN THE CABIN ON DAY THREE. IT'S SUICIDE, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. Only use Mark with the flashing sweater in the middle of the lake. Other notes about the game for myself: I try to stay away from most of the forests and the cave; it's too much of a maze to navigate through. I never found a pitchfork or an axe. Since I beat the game without them, I can do without them. Forget about lighting up the fireplaces. There is no frigging point to that, and it's NOT A TORCH BUT A LIGHTER. GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT.All in all, I am very surprised that LJN finally made a game that was worth playing. The people who don't understand how to play Friday the 13th will find it as one of the worst games ever, but the people that actually understood it will appreciate the gameplay a lot and find it a very underrated game. Friday the 13th, simply put, is a purely strategy game. Interestingly, I am very surprised that Nintendo actually gave a seal of approval for Friday the 13th. The game is a rarity under these circumstances back then because Nintendo strived to release appropriately made, family-type games. However, Friday the 13th was rather a scary game to play.

At that time, I also owned an Atari 800XL with Ultima III: Exodus and Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, which are really enchanting RPG, if you don't mind the crude graphics, so I was hoping Hydlide would be another Ultima, but boy was I wrong. Let's get with the music: it's some of the worst video game music I have ever heard! Cheap ripoff of the Indiana Jones theme song which keeps repeating itself over and over every 15 seconds. I never wanted to play this game unless the volume was turned off because the music will get on your nerves in no time flat. This &quot;music&quot; (which I refuse to think of as music) sounds like the worst garbage you'd hear from a music box. The graphics are very crude looking, and even for the 8-bit NES capability, it's really horrible (the graphics of Bionic Commando is miles better than this garbage). Heck, even the old Atari 8-bit adapation of the Ultima series looks better. How about playability? Well you have to run in to slimes and other monsters and press the A button to try to destroy them, but more chances than not, you'll end up killed. Often if you stand in the wrong vegetation, or you stand in the cemetary, your hit points drain without even monsters touching you (until you gain enough experience points). Basically in this game, you're supposed to collect all three fairies before you're able to kill the dragon. It took me ten years to finally win the game. That was in 1999, I finally won the game because I was finally able to find that third fairy. I didn't realize I was supposed to kill two wizards at once with the wave spell to get that last fairy. Perhaps the worst of this game is when you want to save it. You need to obtain an unnecessiarly long password and write it down. More chances than not you have written the password incorrectly and you pretty much lost what you accomplished in this horrible game. The Ultima series were wonderful, spellbinding RPGs (as long as you owned the Atari, Apple, or Commodore 64, rather than the NES or SNES adaptation). Hydlide is now regarded as not only the worst fantasy RPG ever made, but one of the worst ever made for NES. I have no idea what the makers of this game were thinking. Perhaps they were trying to cash in on the Legend of Zelda fad of the time and fell horribly flat. I have played much better NES games, including their adaptation of Willow, as well as Shadowgate, which means you are much better off checking out those games than Hydlide, unless you want to see just how bad games can get.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "The worst game of all time", "unixReviewTime": 1002672000, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2001"}

First off, the game breaks the standard that you don't touch enemies because it hurts you. In this game you hold the A button to change to attack mode and then blindly run into the enemy to hope that you win. If you die you lose everything and start all over from the beginning, and you will die a lot in this game.The sound is horrible, the music is the same seven second loop of a theme that sounds very much like the Indiana Jones theme song.The graphics are okay for the NES I suppose, I can't knock those too much since the system wasn't that powerful.The save system is misleading and led to a very angry me. In the menu there is an option to save, load and password. I hate passwords and so I just saved and quit. Well the carriage has no internal battery, so the save only works for if it is still on. You have to use the really long password to reload your game. And of course it changes every single time you access the password screen.I have only scratched the surface of the confusion and bad design choices that is Hydlide.

You can tell because the main character (a sword-swinging knight) is the same guy from the previous game.In this adventure, you are no longer treated to infinite continues.  This means the challenge is EXACTLY right.  I can make it to the end of the game, but even after all these years I was never able to beat it.  That final boss is HARD.This game is probably better than the original if only because you now get to explore forest, water, ice and fire worlds.  Yeah, I know, EVERY game seems to have those kind of levels.  Remember, back in the late 80's a game like this was pretty influential and certainly unique.  We were NOT exposed to countless games that were merely rip-offs of other games, unlike today, where it seems like platform games are basically a thing of the past.Thanks to the lack of creative ideas to make something fresh in the world of platform gaming, people are now sick of the genre.  The fact that everyone is now obsessed with realism in gaming means that an overwhelming obsession with a game like Iron Sword will never return.  That makes the game stand out in a positive way, in my opinion.I *strongly* believe, as crazy as this might sound, that the music in Iron Sword is the VERY BEST music a video game can possibly have.  Yes, I know I'm *extremely* crazy for thinking this way, but it's true.  I can't believe music THIS good even exists.  Heck, I probably never would have even had an obsession with music if I never had encountered this excellent game.I put the music in this game on the same level as the music from my favorite bands, like the Moody Blues.  Iron Sword features melodic themes that actually keep building and building in melodies and musical ideas, something 95% of other NES games didn't do.  Most NES games kept repeating the same couple notes over and over.  Not so in Iron Sword.  It's music on a whole other level.  Almost like progressive rock music.  Some of the programmers must have been fans of Genesis or Yes.As for the gameplay, it's basically the same as the previous game except now, as I said above, you explore a variety of different worlds.  The challenge has been increased a lot.  You have to be careful not to die too many times or else you will have to return to the beginning of the game.  Not really a bad thing, though.  After all, NES games were challenging, and that's what made the games so addicting- we kept coming back to them despite dying repeatedly.  If you were to compare the challenge in Iron Sword to other NES games, I'd say it's not so hard then.  But if you want to compare Iron Sword to, oh I don't know, Resident Evil 4, Iron Sword is a pretty tough cookie then.Overall, jumping around on high platforms slashing enemies never gets old when it's done correctly.

The controls weren't as tight as most other sidescrolling/action games were, so I found it frustrating at times to deal with the character and trying to keep him alive. It got frustrating especially at times where there were a lot of enemies, because you only got a limited amount of Continues. These two aspects were my biggest gripes about this game.But that's not the only thing that really bothered me. The ending was very disappointing. After the challenge level of this game, the ending was very short and simplistic - and totally not worth all the time spent trying to beat the game itself. The final boss battle is especially frustrating because of said lack of tight control, so after the boss was defeated, the ending really let me down.

For those that don't know, the famous Italian actor name Fabio Lanzoni is the model posing with the sword on the game's cover like a bad-ass and its a common marketing tool to get kids' parents (including a horny middle aged housewife or single mother - lol) to waste their hard earned money on a mediocre game for their kids.  For starters, the character's (Kuros) sword attack is very short range and awkward (you don't stand a chance against any melees when neccessary).  There are other alternative attacks like projectile spells, but they deplete your magic very quickly and they must be conserved for the elemental boss battles of which swifter than lightning strategies are mandatory.  Weapon upgrades don't help as much and you can't perform a jump attack which is neccessary for those multiple airborne creatures that must be warded off.  The jump configurations are useless and I thought it was me, but its hard to steer while in the air. The game's music is pleasing and so are the graphics and color schemes.  The game's objectives are simple and to the point - defeating all four elemental guardians who stand in your way to obtain the iron sword you must use to defeat the evil Malkil in the Icefire Mountain.  To progress through each level, Kuros must find a golden artifact for each Animal King for each elemental domain and they will help you advance toward the domain so he can find the neccessary magic spells and armor/weapon upgrades (range of the weapon still sucks) needed to defeat each Guardians.  As I said before the controls are very flawed and adding on the the difficulty is the absent \"after hit\" invisiblity, fast depleting life bar, difficulty in seeing whats ahead before its too late due to the screen's influent pace, and limited continues.  Iron Sword looks like it could've been a very good game, but due to the mild success of the previous game and the cover art of the game, it misleaded many gamers and kids wasted their money and time on this mediocre title.  The game designers are laughing their heads off and collecting their money while many frustrated gamers like myself are biting the controls as early as level 1 because we die from multiple enemy attacks due to the cumbersome controls.  The game designers did'nt want to repeat the same formula as simular themed great games like The Legend of Zelda, Gauntlet, and Castlevania, but I think they took three steps back by trying to emulate an average game like Capcom's Ghosts & Goblins, but they failed.

Sure, you think he's adorable and you want to cuddle him.  But be warned: many people think the same way about koala bears.  And what happens when you try picking one of those up?  That's right.  And the same thing might happen to you with Kirby.Kirby is one dangerous boy/man/puffball/lady whatever.  You should know just by looking at him that he's capable of something angry.  He's cute and cuddly on the outside but on the inside it's a whole other story.  He's a vicious creature.  You think you know him, you don't.  What would possess Nintendo to create such a monster?  Maybe revenge, for players everywhere becoming angry whenever they lost a life playing one of their games, and therefore throwing their controller in anger and breaking it.  But then Nintendo would be making money that way when players returned to buy another controller, so Kirby's creation must be some kind of secret Nintendo undercover behind closed doors genius operation.Think about it. Kirby was meant to fade away with time.  His popularity was meant to hang around for a couple years, and then when the NES went out and the Super NES came in, Kirby should have disappeared.  But he didn't.  He continued to appear in new adventures with Nintendo's new video game systems and he became a survivor, and he's still going strong 15 years later.  It wasn't supposed to happen.  How could it happen?  Nintendo is about ready to release another video game system.  I think next year.  Will Kirby make an appearance on that system?  I think he will.  It gives me chills to think about the things Kirby is capable of.  He won't go away.  This wasn't meant to happen.  Nintendo created a monster and now it's out of control.So as you see Kirby is not such a friendly puffball.  It's all a disguise.  Nintendo knows it, and you should know it too.

The NES was replaced the even more powerful Super NES, which was a whole new journey for gaming. Most people (by 1993) had either upgraded to a Super NES or were trying out the Sega Genesis. Nintendo was constanly releasing Super NES game after Super NES game to compete with Sega, and yet somehow Kirby ended up on NES instead of SNES. It was no accident. Nintendo put tons of love into this game and pushed every element of it to maximum power. The result is the beautiful world of Kirby. Beautiful is not an exaggeration, either. Dream Land looks like it came right out of a Nintendo fan's dream. Kirby is a wonderful pink, the skys are blue with thick clouds, and even the enemies look cute enough to hug. The musical score also feels like it came directly from a dream. Kirby's Adventure had the musical score ever on the NES. After the awesome How to draw Kirby intro music immediatly kicks in as Kirby falls to the title screen. Every tune fits the level perfectly. The final fight with King Dedede just plays the regular boss theme, hinting that something else is going to happen. And the gameplay... it is the most amazing thing ever. Kirby does everything. He can fly. He can jump. Then you accidently tap the B button... and he can inhale his enemies. Then press down and... he now has the enemie's power. If he eats a tire he becomes one. If he eats a laser orb he can shoot lasers. If he eats an alarm clock he can \"sing\". This gives the game a very unique strategy. Sometimes Kirby must have a certain ability to access parts of a level. (To light that cannon he must be able to breath fire. To get down to that area he needs to turn to stone.) And the game also contains more then 50 levels. When I beat King Dedede I expected the average \"You are a hero! The end!\" junk that goes with most NES games. Instead I got quite a surprise. And after the ending I can not help but sigh. While I have seen really awesome games, none of them are as well made as Kirby's Adventure.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The end of the NES adventure", "unixReviewTime": 1345680000, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2012"}

Therefore, once you 'die' the difficulty becomes much greater.The level design is innovative which a slightly different style and theme for each.  The top down perspective levels were good, but I preferred the design and flow of the side scrolling levels.

The fantastic theme music, which is still the best music in a Mega Man game to date. Every single tune in this game is amazingly creative and memorable. If you don't think so you're crazy.Another thing that fascinates me is how people can never decide which of the first three Mega Man games is the best one. The first one I have never played, but they say it's extremely challenging, and because it only features 6 bosses, I don't think it's possible for me to prefer that one over Mega Man 2.Then we have Mega Man 3, which video game fans like to compete with Mega Man 2 to find out just which game delivers the ultimate Mega Man experience. Many people will try to say 3 is the best NES Mega Man game, while many others will say the clear winner is the 2nd one. Which one do I prefer? I have played 3, and while that one was also a fun, addicting action game, I think this one tops it. It doesn't smear it, it just beats it. The level design and the weapons Mega Man can equip just excite me more in this game. The creative juices were really flowing here.Mega Man 2, despite Capcom probably not completely sure if the Mega Man name will take off or not, marks where everything fell into place for the series and it feels SO MUCH like a classic because everything about this game feels so right. Mega Man 3 feels more like \"just another Mega Man game\" (though a great one- it just doesn't have that special feel, though of course many would disagree).Mega Man 4 is also a good game to own, and by the time Mega Man 5 was released it felt like players were thinking to themselves \"ok Capcom, that's enough!\". But really, all 5 of those NES Mega Man games are probably worth owning. I also have never played the 6th installment. People don't seem to like that one so you may want to avoid it. From the small amount of pictures I have seen of the game, it does look different from the previous 5. Though graphics aren't everything, so who knows if I'd like it or not.I really don't have any complaints with Mega Man 2. It's a lot of fun playing this game 15 years after I first rented and eventually bought. I can't remember where I bought it. Probably a yard sale. Back in the day you could buy NES games used at yard sales, garage sales and whatnot for extremely cheap prices. Just think, there was a point where I probably would have only had to pay a dollar for the first Mega Man game. Wow, it's definitely not like that today.I'm still angry that the video store in my town always had the Mega Man 1 cardboard box on the shelf, and when I took the box up to the man behind the counter so I could rent the game, I was always disappointed to find that the game was never available because someone never returned it, and to this day I never got to play it.Mega Man 2 offers a nice challenge, but unlike many NES games it's actually possible to beat this game with some practice. That's how a challenging game should be- hard at first, and the more you play the better you get. With practice you WILL beat this game, because there's really no place in any of the levels that can be called frustrating. Just a nice small challenge all the way through.This game has it all, folks. Great level design, fantastic music, weapons and bosses that make you want to keep coming back to it again and again. There's really nothing bad that can be said about it. It's Mega Man at his most Mega Man-y.

If anything, it set itself up for Mega Man 2 to be a success. But not even Capcom expected how much of a success it would turn out to be: millions of copies were sold across the world and Mega Man would be quickly recognized as much as Nintendo's mascot, Mario. And when Mega Man 2 was released, the Blue Bomber returned in the breakout NES sequel that had gamers in a frenzy. I never bought it because I borrowed it from my best friend numerous times and it was worth it.Mega Man 2 had Mega Man return to save his world. Dr. Wily was really upset that he lost to Mega Man before and he vowed to get his revenge. To show he was better than Dr. Light and to crush Mega Man, Dr. Wily invented eight Robot Masters and challenged Mega Man to beat them and to fight him again. You picked one of eight stages to play through and beat the Robot Master to gain its special weapon. In addition to the special weapons, you were able to acquire three adapters that helped you cross gaps, climb walls or reach platforms out of reach. Once you beat all eight stages, you were whisked off to Dr. Wily's castle. There you had to play through six more stages, filled with more enemies, boss characters, the same eight Robot Masters from before and finally, Dr. Wily and his new robot contraptions. The game provided passwords so you could save your progress and come back later to finish your game.The PROS: Capcom responded to those gamers who felt the first game was too hard to beat by offering easy and hard modes. Because of that move, Mega Man 2 was accessible to every gamer and that helped it gain popularity. You had new Robot Masters, new weapons and more stages to play through. Everything here was better: the graphics, music, stage layouts, enemies and boss characters. The sound effects were mostly the same from the first game but were still good and so were the controls. The new weapon adapters were pretty cool and helped out in certain sections of the game. Since the game was longer, the password system was a nice addition so that you could play for a bit, copy the password and then use it later on to finish the game. Mega Man 2 was the first game to introduce \"energy tanks\": a health power up that filled up your energy bar when you needed it (the only catch was that you could carry up to four at a time.)The CONS: Mega Man 2 went down in the franchise's history as the easiest game in the series to beat. If you played it through the easy mode, it was an absolute but enjoyable walk in the park. But if you played it through the hard mode, the game gave you a mild challenge but nowhere near what you saw in Mega Man. Some players wanted more of a challenge besides those two modes but Capcom wanted everyone to enjoy the game so that's why it wasn't as hard as the first game. When you use the passwords, they saved your progress as far as how many robots you beat. If you used it during one of the stages in Dr. Wily's castle, the game always brought you back to the first stage of the castle. Also, the passwords never let you kept the energy tanks or extra lives you collected; you started without any energy tanks and three lives.Mega Man 2 was and still is regarded as one of the best in the NES series. To this date, it stirs the debate as to which NES Mega Man game reigns supreme and it's always been between Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3. No matter which game was your favorite, this one had a lot of fans and brought a lot of good memories to those gamers who were fortunate enough. If you're a Mega Man fan, you have this game in some form: the actual NES cartridge, the Mega Man Anniversary Collection released for the PS2 and Gamecube consoles, or downloaded it to your Wii from the Virtual Console Service (500 points.)

Little did I know, I was about to play a game in a series that would keep me engrossed for years to come.In case you are not familiar, the premise of MM is to defeat enemy \"Robot Masters\" and gain their powers to defeat yet other robot masters (RM), since every RM has a vulnerability to another RM's weapon: an ingenious concept. This is the first title in the series to feature 8 RM's (MM1 has only 6). Also, if you are looking for a game in which you can set or beat high scores, this is not the game for you since there isn't a score keeper (MM1 does have a score tally though).This game almost didn't happen because Capcom actually did not feel that MM1 was successful enough to warrant a sequel: it was Keiji Inafune, the series producer, that persuaded management to allow him to pursue the development of this game and only on his time. The rest of the gaming universe is thankful for that! The MM series is notable for it's extremely memorable and outstanding music and gameplay as well as great graphics (during that time of course). Many credit the immense success of the series to this particular title and rightfully so.

No ifs, ands or butts about it, Mega Man 2 single-handedly spearheaded my interest in the blue bomber and video games in general. But as simple of a joy as the game is even today, there's something my ever-evolving self has to ask, has Mega Man 2 been hurt by the hype?I ask this question because over the years I've seen other gamer's continuously put other landmark titles I grew up on unrealistically high pedestals. Final Fantasy VII may have been great, but does a sealed black-boarder copy of the game really warrant four hundred dollars? Xenogears may have had a psychotically layered narrative that turned it a playable anime, but was the game really perfect? Metal Gear Solid put you in the ever convincing shoes of a professional killer but can its aging gameplay match the cinematic quality of its story? It's rampant fandom that ignores such obvious questions that makes me wonder if such views are damaging.Damaging or not, even after replaying Mega Man 2 for the first time in the last few years, I can't even begin to tear this game down. Sure, it's rather lax in the difficulty department, but that's an area I've never been too concerned with when it comes to games in general. Even running through the game like I was on auto-pilot wasn't enough hurt it, which leads me to wonder how one could even take down Mega Man 2? A stake dipped in holy water?

Part two in a series of nine games.The Mega Man series was created in 1987 as a result of an experiment where Capcom wanted to try adding the feature of stealing boss weapons in a platform game, instead of simply having the main character be always the same throughout the entire game. The first game actually fared decently when it was released, but it was no hit by any means. However, Capcom saw it to be successful enough to warrant a sequel, so they gathered all their best programmers and put together what could be considered the series's defining moment. Afterall, MM2 was responsible for Mega Man becoming a household name and spawning TONS of sequels over the years. It's my second favorite MM game(after 4 that is). Read on for the synopsis of this legendary title:PROS:-THERE ARE NOW 8 DIFFERENT BOSSES TO FIGHT. This is simply awesome because not only does the player get more options of what to do, but also THE BOSSES IN THIS GAME ARE SOME OF THE COOLEST MM BOSSES EVER CONCEIVED. Quickman, Crashman, and Metalman are personal favorites of mine. Plus, at least half of the game's bosses present a reasonable challenge.-THE ADDITION OF THE ITEM ADAPTORS. There are three different items to be acquired throughout the game, each having its own unique transportation usefulness. For instance, Item #3 is good for climing walls with, while Item #2 is useful for flying across large pits. These are all much better than the previous game's Magnet Beam Generator.-Now and forever on, YOU CAN SAVE YOUR PROGRESS WITH PASSWORDS. IMHO, I find that passwords in a MM game are pointless because the games don't take very long to play through. However, if you do lack patience and can't sit still for an hour or two, using passwords will help you.-THE LEVELS ARE ALL VARIED AND FUN TO GO THROUGH. Example: Crashman's level is mostly vertical climbing, while Bubbleman's stage forces you to wade through water avoiding spikes, and Quickman's level involves racing to the bottom avoiding the advancing beams. No stage before the Wily levels ever gets repetitive in this game.-THE MUSIC IN THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY GENIOUS. All the tunes, with the exception of one, are catchy and fit the Mega Man games PERFECTLY. Several tunes really stand out, such as Airman, Bubbleman, Flashman, the boss theme, and the first Wily Stage. Of all the MM games, MM2 arguably has the most consistently good soundtrack.-INTRODUCTION OF THE E-TANKS. These are a must in MM games. When you grab one, you can fill up your health to the max, but the greatest benefit is that you can save 4 tanks up for when you really need them, such as boss battles. Even with the E-tanks, the game's challenge factor doesn't suffer one bit.-TWO LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY: EASY AND NORMAL. For the most part, playing the game on normal is the best option because it keeps the game hard enough to offer enough challenge for seasoned MM veterans. However, if you're new to the series, playing it on easy mode is a great way to get equainted with the controls.CONS:-Beating the game on easy mode gives you exactly the same result as playing it on normal, so the replay value is diminished slightly.-One thing that isn't a real big deal but has always bothered me is the realistic sense of Woodman's weapon. A leaf shield? Come on. I must congradulate Dr. Light on a job well done for creating a super metal blue robot that can be destroyed by fluttering leaves.-Although most all of the music in this game is very good, the tune in the 2nd half of Wily's castle gets repetitive, and grating.-Believe it or not, MM2 ACTUALLY HAS THE WEAKEST STORY OF ALL OF THE MM GAMES; NES, SNES, and PSX MM games included. Here's all the plot really is: Dr. Wily is back for revenge with 8 more robots to take over the world. That's it. How unoriginal and contrived is that? Good thing this &quot;story&quot; happened to be in an early MM game as opposed to one of its numerous sequels.Despite a few slight shortcomings, this is THE mandatory MM game to have on the NES, and should be the first game for those of you getting into the series. 5 stars overall. Even though the MM series couldn't exist without the first game, it certainly wouldn't have taken off and become a huge franchise if not for MM2. If you have a softspot for good oldschool gaming, then you've come to the right place. This game coined my favorite dialog phrase used in a MM game.

But his success is owed to this pheonomenal game.  The first, although somewhat successful, did not have the commercial impact as this did.  Repeating the formula of the first Mega Man with giving you multiple stages and you chosing which one you want to tackle first and adding two bosses and dropping the score you get when beating the bosses, Capcom came up with 8 great bosses and a tremendous game.

The story is that you are Mega Man and you must defeat the evil Dr. Wily and his eight robot masters. The gameplay has a strategic element with the level selection. Each boss has a special power that you acquire after defeating them and this power is very effective against one of the seven remaining bosses. It is up to you to decide which boss to use which special power on. You can also get three special items (cleverly titled Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3) from your maker, Dr. Light, which can aid you in progressing through each level.The level design is excellent and rather large (for an NES game at least). The hardest level by far is Heat Man's level, which features disappearing and reappearing blocks that you must jump on to avoid certain death. Though the levels are inherently linear in the fact that they lead to the same place, there are different paths you can choose to take. One example is choosing which ladder to use in the Crash Man stage. Using the ladder on the left will avoid enemies but require you to be a better jumper and using the ladder on the right is a straight shot to the top, but there are many more enemies to fight. The levels are all themed according to the bosses and the enemies are wild-looking and creative. I always loved the fire-breathing robot dogs in Wood Man's stage. This level variety also gives the game a lot of replayability, which is a big plus.The music in Mega Man games is always phenomenal, and Mega Man 2 is no exception. Pretty much every stage has great music that gets you in the mood and only adds to the enjoyment of the game. The boss loading screen is my personal favorite; signifying a challenge ahead, but still sounding triumphant. The password selection screen also has a very mellow and strangely catchy theme.On a side note, I've always found it interesting that both Mega Man 1 and 2 have a cover depicting a real-looking human as Mega Man, but with Mega Man 3 they adopted a more cartoonish looking image for the character (and rightfully so)!So all in all, a classic for the NES and my personal favorite Mega Man game.

It allows you to choose which levels and bosses to go after first. Once you defeat them, you gain their weapons. This is vital, as some bosses and levels are nearly impossible without the right weapon combinations. It does allow you to \"save\" your progress with a bingo style code system that allows you opt out of defeating levels you already completed.

I heard many good things about Mega Man 2 on Nintendo Power magazines and a few of my peers, but I just did'nt take the time to play it.  Unlike many 70's and 80's babies, I did'nt own a huge library of Nintendo titles because they were very expensive and my dad encouraged us to rent them before we decide if we want to own them, but I should have given this a shot back in the day.  Mega Man 2 was rented out most of the time, but I should've snagged it that one moment it was staring at my face.  I finally bought a used copy off Amazon that still plays great.Mega Man must face Dr Wily, again so he must go through 8 of his new creations and absorb each and every one of their powers to use against robots that varies in weaknesses.  The most useful weapons to use are the Metal weapon and the Quick weapon of which may be used on almost all occasions without quickly depleting your power bar.  I haven't yet completed the game, of which I intend to do, but it is a hard game and requires quick strategy, serious thinking, and moderate memorization to get through the first few of Dr. Wily's stages.  Just because a game is hard does'nt always mean that its bad.  It is one of the top 10 NES games and the gameplay/graphics/greatness more than proves it.  It was well advanced for 1988 and it still a great game to play in 2008, so its better being 20 years late than never having to play it at all.  I will plan to get Mega Man 1 and 3 in the future, but I will ignore the last 3 in the NES series.  The reason why I did'nt get the PS2 Anniversary collection is because I heard that the last 3 Mega Man games were not that great and I did'nt want to risk it with my money.  Another reason is that I like the joy of building up my NES library with good games that I did'nt get to do in the late 1980's and early 1990's.

It may not have a fantastic plot, but those of us who remember the NES days weren't too concerned with plot anyway (remember, you were Mario going to rescue the Princess from the clutches of King Koopa).  Mega Man II introduced a few things to the series that the first one lacked.  The biggest new assest was perhaps the Energy Tank.  While you could only carry four, it was nice that for once I didn't have to go back and forth killing enemies for energy pellets.The gameplay was a step up for this.  Mega Man II also has more balanced difficulty.  It isn't just the energy tanks, it's that you're more likely to survive in cases where you can't.  There are eight robot masters as opposed to six, and the weapons are a little better.  The element of Robot Masters being weak to other Robot Master weapons is still there, and it works out even better here than it did in the first one.  It's a bit more unpredictable.The difficulty may be balanced, but it isn't by any means the hardest of the Mega Man series (the first one is).  It's actually one of the easier ones in the series.  The bulk of the difficulty may come from Quick Man's stage, and even that can be taken care of quite easily.  Taking on the robot masters a second time is also pretty easy when you've got all their weapons to use against them, and they always drop an energy pellet that restores probably more damage than they'll do to you.  In other words, the game is not a challenge.  There are still moments where it's difficult, but for the most part, unlike the first game, it seems more managable than the first game.The music is also a lot better, and so are the graphics.  There are fewer graphical glitches, and the music gets stuck in your head for a long time.  Mega Man II is a huge step above the original Mega Man in all respects.  It plays better, it's not nearly as difficult (even on the difficult setting) and has fantastic music to boot.

Don't get me wrong, there's several difficult moment in X5 and X6, and Mega Man 5 isn't exactly a walk through the colorful cherry orchard park either, but overall MM4 might take the cake for the most consistently difficult Mega Man game I've ever put inside one of my video game consoles.  I remember my mother renting this game for me at the video game store uptown back in 1990-1991, and of course, I was the foolish one who picked it out assuming it'd be loads of fun and... well yeah, the game *is* loads of fun, but the constant relentless assault from the many enemies you encounter in nearly every single stage is nearly enough to make me wish I hadn't asked for this game so many times during my childhood.The music is REALLY good though.  Who knows, the music itself may be the biggest reason I used to rent this game so many times back then.  Skull Man in particular has a theme that's really melodic.  On the negative, the first Wily stage has terrible music.  This game moreso than all the other Mega Man games reminds me of that robot movie from the mid 80's called Short Circuit.  That movie used to excite me like no other.  The levels are all packed with several obstacles.  You have spikes which we've pretty much grown accustomed to in the Mega Man series by this point, moving block platforms that can be an absolutely *nightmare* if you don't handle your jumping patterns correctly (and when I was a kid- surprise surprise, missing and falling these particular platforms is how I ended up losing the most lives).At least Mega Man has a sliding move that's really effective when the situation ever gets TOO intense.  Quite often you can simply slide beyond the danger and make it to a temporary safe area.  Thank goodness for this feature!  Where the difficulty REALLY increases in during the Wily stages.  Trust me, you don't even want to know how hard some of these stages are.  The one stage with spikes on the block platforms that actually *rotate* to a different spot... MY goodness!!  You're in for more than a rude awakening, that's for sure!  This is the one Mega Man game I'm always reluctant to play due to the high challenge it brings time and time again.  It does get easier with practice, but let's be honest here- if you wake up on the wrong side of the bed and experience an off day, your timing will be off too.  You cannot have one of those days and expect to blow through a game like this without any trouble.  You've been warned.The boss fights are hard too mainly because if you happen to come unprepared such as say, your weapon meter is nearly empty when you arrive to the fight or you simply don't have the right weapon in your possession, the bosses will make you pay for that, and the regular arm cannon might not be good enough to get the job done either.  Another benefit is that Rush the dog makes an appearance and he helps with some of the harder to reach areas by climbing on top of him and sailing across (or up) the screen.Overall, Mega Man's fourth adventure offers a significantly increased challenge in comparison to the previous three, so please PLEASE keep this in mind if you so much as dare to play this game.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "it's all mega", "unixReviewTime": 1354233600, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2012"}

In 1992, they released Mega Man 4 for the NES. While it was more of the same, they kept the game fresh with more variety in the stages and a difficulty level that was tougher than what gamers saw in the previous game. It was worth it and everyone was happy that Mega Man kept on going.The story is short and sweet: A new scientist, Dr. Cossack challenged Mega Man to defeat his batch of Robot Masters and then to see him in his castle. Of course, Mega Man does what he has to do. No one was surprised to see that Dr. Wily put him up to up since he kidnapped his daughter. In the end, you face Dr. Wily in his own castle for the final showdown. The setup was the same like the other Mega Man games: choose one stage out of 8 stages, defeat the Robot Master and use the weapon to defeat the next robot and so on and so on. You'd reach Dr. Cossack's castle comprised of 4 stages, then you had to fight in Dr. Wily's castle for the final 4 stages, beating the eight Robot Masters again and finally defeating Dr. Wily. A password system was available to use so you can continue your game later.The PROS: The only way that gamers would have kept playing Mega Man was if there was enough variety in the stages and new game play mechanics were introduced. Fortunately, Capcom delivered in these areas. The graphics and music were good. The controls were the same as it always been so no problems there. It was this game where Capcom first gave Mega Man the ability to power up a shot before you release it to make it stronger and do more damage. His trademark slide returned and so did Rush, his faithful robot dog. A new ally, Eddie, made his first appearance here; he brought a random power up to help Mega Man whenever he was summoned. Gamers also welcomed back the tougher difficult level that was absent in Mega Man 2 and 3.The CONS: At this point, if you have played any of the previous three games, then Mega Man 4 is no different. It won't change your mind if you weren't a fan of the classic NES series.Mega Man 4 was more of the same but fans of the series weren't tired yet.

Mega Man fans are especially aware of this, but even with games that don't truly evolve from sequel to sequel each one manages to contain a feel of its own. The first Mega Man was a rough sketch of a portrait Mega Man 2 would quickly streamline. Mega Man 3 would take some liberties with its game play and ultimately stifle the flow that would have greatly benefited the series. But what about Mega Man 4? Does it restore the flow of chi or only intensify an abstract case of mental blockage?There are several things about Mega Man 4 that are more than welcome. The robot master crew is probably the most challenging out of the NES line-up and we see the introduction of some new characters like Dr. Cossack and his daughter. Okay, so these characters aren't exactly deep (like any of Mega Man's characters are) and only serve to fuel the \"fake antagonist\" scheme employed by the following two games, but they help hide the fact that Mega Man 4 is Mega Man 3's hangover. It's dumbfounding how even the smallest things made me reflect on the last game, not the one in front of me.Because of this, Mega Man 4 lacks an identity. As laughable as that may sound given how many games there are in the series, it's this same train of thought that makes it a very noticeable and serious problem. The silver lining to such a conundrum is that this indirectly gives Mega Man 5 and 6 a head start right out of the gate, something that is of the utmost importance for the titles that wrap up Mega Man's time on the NES.Despite the fact the Mega Man 4 ends on somewhat of a downer, fans of the blue bomber will find little reason not to add this to their collection if they don't have it already.

Capcom released the game in 1992 to moderate success.Between MEGA MAN III and this game, Capcom considered taking Mega Man to the SNES, but decided to delay Mega Man's arrival to the new console for a further two years.  There is some debate about this, but the general consensus in the gaming community is that Capcom made the last three NES Mega Man games because they were easy games to make, the development team knew had to make a good product, they were cheap to make, and would provide a steady income for the company.  While it is true the second trilogy of MM games, while not nearly as good as the first (simply because the formula wasn't so tired and stale by that time) are very good games, they are completely overshadowed by the first trilogy.The storyline is rather simple, but then, most NES games didn't have the most complex storylines to boast (most involve an evil lizard king and a kidnapped princess).  It turns out after you defeat Dr. Cossack, Proto Man shows up with the good doctor's Kalinka.  Proto Man reveals that Dr. Wily is behind this world domination attempt (yet again), and he kidnapped Cossack's daughter and forced Cossack to build the eight robots.  After you defeat Cossack, Mega Man sees Dr. Wily, and chases him into a newly constructed Skull Castle.  For an NES game, the storyline isn't that bad, but unfortunately Capcom would use the exact same device for MM V and MM VI as well.  This I refer to as the Fake Villain Trilogy.Following the masterpieces that are MM II and MM III, this game, while a good game in and of itself, feels simply like more of the same, and there's not any drastic changes in game play, although there are several new features.*Mega Man can now charge the \"Mega Buster\", to fire a more powerful shot.*Two new items are introduced: A grappling hook known as the Wire Adapter and a Balloon Dispenser (Ballon Adapter).  These items have not appeared in any other game.*Fliptop (Eddie), a helpful robot, is introduced and gives you random powerups in certain stages.*Unfortunately, passwords no longer save your accumulated Energy Tanks*Like the first game, you can now reenter levels to replay them, a feature absent from MM II and MMIII; however, the boss lair is now empty.*Also the first game since MM II to have forced scrolling in one of the levels.There are several similarities between this and MM II.  The fanfare for level intros and when you defeat the robot masters are very similar to the corresponding music in MM II.  Also, Dr. Wily's last stage is shaped like an L, and while II has acid drips you must avoid, MM IV's level has robo slugs the player can use to rebuild their weapon supply and energy.  MM VI has this same L shape on the last Dr. Wily level, but in that game the level is much more varied.  Like MM II, when you finally do confront Dr. Wily, the final battle takes place in a darkened lab room.Overall, the Robot Masters are rather imaginative, and the levels well designed.  Pharaoh Man is probably the hardest robot master of all six NES games, and has a very powerful weapon.  Skull Man is pretty cool.  Drill Man is a little derivative of Hard Man from MM III, but still a good design. of. The other Robot Masters (Toad Man, Dust Man, Dive Man, Bright Man, and Ring Man) are fortunately pretty original, and it's clear Capcom hasn't come to the bottom of the barrel as far as ideas for Robot Masters go just yet.For those who like the first MM trilogy, this is certainly a worthwhile game to play.  But as good as the second trilogy is, the first trilogy is great, and it's those games you should turn too if you really want to play the best of the classic series.  The second trilogy is just largely a repeat of the first trilogy.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Yea, we get a new mad scientist to fight.  Well, not really.

An obvious step up in fact.  Enemies and obstacles are twice as aggressive.  Maybe it's just me but I feel the music isn't nearly as good as the first two MM games.  In fact MM4 and 5 have significantly more interesting theme music as well.Again, just like my experience with the other MM games in the series that aren't MM2, Mega Man 3 will be remembered for being yet *another* game in the series that had a challenge too overwhelming for me a youngster.  I believe I completed one stage and that's it.  This would have been back in the early 90's.  It's a shame I felt the game was too hard back then and gave up.  Nowadays I can approach any kind of challenge with open arms and play it despite how many times I'll probably lose.What makes this game so hard are the boss fights, and a few of the stages as well (such as the first portion of Gemini Man's stage- I can't tell you HOW many times those fireballs knocked me into a nearby bottomless pit, ugh!).  These boss fights are much MUCH faster and target Mega Man more precisely than the boss fights in the rest of the MM games.  This means you better be prepared to walk into the battle well-equipped!  If not, well, kiss your robotic buns goodnight, haha.  The trade off is that the part where you have to re-fight the 8 bosses before the final Wily confrontation can be finished in several seconds if you go into the battles completely certain which weapon is weak against said boss.Rush the dog is awesome.  He can boost Mega Man to higher areas or glide Mega Man across the screen away from all danger below.  He's very convenient for a game like this.  I also notice in one stage with bubbles that it was probably an influence for Bubble Crab's stage from Mega Man X2.  Overall, great game with a big challenge- it takes skill and a whole lot of patience to master these older Mega Man games.  Actually it takes skill and patience just to figure out the proper order of the stages/bosses, which helps ease the challenge a bit.

Countless games had been released and created many memories for gamers around the world. The Mega Man series were running full steam thanks to the underground buzz of Mega Man and the breakout success of Mega Man 2. Revered for the classic shoot and jump game play, memorable Robot Masters and awesome music, the games were a joy to play through and Capcom had to keep up with the demand for more Mega Man games. After releasing a Mega Man title for the Game Boy, they headed back to the drawing board for 1990's Mega Man 3. It was at that point that many felt (including myself) the NES Mega Man series reached the highest point.The story for Mega Man 3 goes like this: After being defeated twice, Dr. Wily decides to be a good guy and help Dr. Light create a new peace keeping robot for their world. In order for it to be fully powered, they send Mega Man to get energy crystals. Just as he leaves for his journey, robots go crazy and threaten to halt the introduction of the new robot. Now, Mega Man had to get the energy crystals and find out why the robots went crazy. Of course, in the end, Dr. Wily was behind the commotion and stole the robot so he can use it to take over the world. Surely, Mega Man stopped him......and found out that he had a brother, Proto Man.The premise of Mega Man 3 is the same as the previous two entries: Choose one stage out of eight stages filled with enemies and a Robot Master. Get the special weapons from all Robot Masters by completing all eight stages. Next, you moved on to the next set of stages (four \"Doc Robot\" levels where you face off against robots \"possessed\" by the spirits of the Robot Masters from Mega Man 2.) Finally, after you clear one extra stage, you reach Dr. Wily's castle and this time it was made up of six stages. By the time you beat the game, you would have played through 19 stages, the most in a Mega Man game out of the entire NES series. There were new additions first introduced to the NES Mega Man series: the ability to slide through narrow gaps between walls, Mega Man's new sidekick (Rush the robot dog) who came with his own adapters that transformed him into various objects, the ability to save up to nine energy tanks and Proto Man, Mega Man's brother who first appeared in disguise as Break Man to test Mega Man. The password system returned to help save your progress so you can continue your game later.The PROS: Mega Man 3 perfected everything that the Mega Man games were known for: a good story, excellent graphics, superb music, good sound effects, perfect controls and a difficulty level that wasn't too easy nor was it too overbearing. Capcom hit all the right notes with new Robot Masters (for the first time one of them was based on an animal, portraying a hint of what has yet to come), new stage layouts, appearances from Mega Man 2's Robot Masters, new abilities, new characters and the longest Mega Man game to grace the NES.The CONS: While it was mentioned in the story, you never ever picked up the energy crystals so it was kind of weird. Some gamers noticed that with this game, the Robot Masters were more prone to receive damage because they didn't have a grace period between hits. This was weird to see but it was just a small fraction against the game since you still had to memorize the robot's attack pattern and avoid touching it.Many gamers agreed that Mega Man 3 was another fun game to play starring the Blue Bomber. It sold very well and ensured that we would see him again. There are good reasons that Mega Man 3 in particular was and is still fondly remembered. All you have to do is play the game. For Mega Man fans, it was awesome. If you weren't a fan by the time it was released, then this game wouldn't sway your opinion. For those who missed out on any of the NES games, you did miss out. Get yourself a copy of this game through any of these methods: the actual cartridge, the Mega Man Anniversary Collection disk (PS2 or GC) or download this game for the Wii from the Virtual Console Cartridge for US $5.00 (500 points.)

I was already a huge MM fan after only having played MM2 but MM3 only strengthened my allegiance.MM3 follows the same basic premise as the previous two installments: beat a robot master and gain his powers to defat the next. The main antagonist is still Dr. Wily (when will he give up?). MM3 is much longer than its predecessor as you are forced to defeat a doppleganger-like robot that takes on the powers of the 8 robot bosses from MM2 in the Spark Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man and Needle Man stages. This is actually pretty annoying, but it was nice to see the old crew again! The 4 extra levels notwithstanding, I thought MM2 was tougher for some reason.This game continues the high precedent set by MM2 (outstanding gameplay, phenomenal music, etc) and builds upon it by giving the Blue Bomber a slide move, which works to get you into tight places and as a speedier alternative to the standard running. This game also marks the first appearance of MM's dog Rush, and he proves to be very useful. Rush can take on the functionality of a jumping board called Rush Coil, which you are outfitted with from the jump. He also takes on the form of a jet (Rush Jet) and a submarine (Rush Submarine).

Even if a fan prefers one of the later installments, it's unlikely that these two games, instrumental in forging Mega Man's identity, end up on equal ground. So which camp am I in? Despite my best effort not to add to the seemingly endless love for Mega Man 2, I have to go with it, not Mega Man 3. But why? While I can't exactly say Mega Man 3 is \"busted,\" there are some design choices at work here that really throw a wench in the experience for me, things that were fine last time out and should have been left alone.A lot of Mega Man 3's problems center around boss fights. First of all, the amount of crash damage one receives from making contact with a robot master is flat out wrong. I can understand this kind of damage being higher from a fortress boss, but I shouldn't lose one-fourth of my health for what is essentially a silly hit. The problems continue as the built in invincibility period after a successful hit on a boss has essentially been eliminated. This means you can score hit upon hit in quick succession without waiting between blows. While one could see pumping ammunition down an enemy's throat as a good thing, there are times were it absolutely destroys any semblance of challenge this title has to offer.The game's other main flaw revolves around the addition of everyone's favorite canine sidekick Rush. Mega Man 2's Item 1, 2 and 3 have been replaced by the Rush Coil, Jet and Submarine. Giving such items more of an identity is appreciated as is their necessity in navigating the levels. What's not welcome is setting up the stages and power-ups in such a manner where the player can get stuck with no recourse (other than to exhaust their lives and continue) because power ups don't respawn after death. This becomes a real issue in the somewhat pointless Doc Robot levels as do continue points.As much as I love Mega Man, I can't give Mega Man 3 the same kind of love I give Mega Man 2. Again, there is no reason to put that game on a pedestal but it is free of the problems found here, as are solid outings like Mega Man 4, 5 and 6.

Not bad but not great. This is definitely an improvement over the last two.\"Mega Man III\" actually has the best story of all six NES titles.  Dr. Light and Dr. Wily are working together to build a giant peace keeping robot named Gamma.  However, the eight robot masters that the two designed to help keep the peace go beserk, stealing 8 power crystals.  The two scientists quickly call Mega Man into action.Mega Man must defeat the eight bosses to regain the crystals.  This set of levels is probably my favorite in any Mega Man game.  They're all very well designed, and just flat-out fun to play.  The Shadow Man level and Snake Man level are both great.But wait, there's more.  After defeating the eight robot masters, four new levels open up (they are remixed or altnerate versions of four regular levels), and robot masters named Doc Robots are masters of these levels.  There are two Doc Robots per level.  While all the Doc Robots look the same, they are actually programmed to act like one of the robot masters in MEGA MAN II.  When you reach the Doc Robot's lair, the sprite of one of the \"Mega Man II bosses descends from top of the screen down into Doc Robot, like the spirit of that perspective boss is inhabiting or animating the Doc Robot's body.Once you defeat the 8 Doc Robot masters, another level opens in the center of the portrait page, entitled BreakMan.  It is a simple one screen level, where you must fight ProtoMan.  Ultimately, it is revealed Proto Man is Mega Man's brother, and built before Mega Man.  Proto Man, who has been kept ambigious throughout the game, has been helping train Mega Man with each fight.After you finish your training level with Proto Man, you now learn that Dr. Wily has stolen the power crystals Mega Man recovered, and has holed up in a new Skull Castle, intent on activating Gamma and reprogramming him to begin yet another attempt to take over the world via thru the campaign of bloody massacre or pogrom.Wily's Castle features several cameos or references to the first two games.*The famous Rock Monster (AKA the Yellow Devil) from the first game makes a return appearance, with a newly designed appearance.*Gamma looks a lot like Gutsman (who, of all the villains in Mega Man, makes the most cameo appearances in other games, his likeness also appears as a Wiley Castle Boss in \"Mega Man III\").*The boss guarding the transporter room in the fourth portion of Dr Wily throws rocks like Gutsman.*Mega Man must fight his clone, just like the original \"Mega Man\".  This  time around, there are three platforms, each with a separate clone.  One clone is real, the other two holograms, and the real clone's location constantly changes between the three platforms.The Dr. Wily stages are fun, although the last incarnation of Dr. Wily is the weakest of all six NES Wily bosses.  With a single top spin, you destroy him.The only two negative things I have to say about the game is this: the story is not really explained, and the inclusion of Top Man.1.  The story is the best in the NES Mega Man Games.  With the other titles, you are given some cut scenes to tell what little story there is.  In \"Mega Man III\", there are no cut scenes initially, so you don't really know the story.  In fact, until you defeat BreakMan and the Dr Wily stage opens up (the Dr Wily levels is proceeded by a cut scene with Dr. Light and Mega Man, revealing Dr Wily is evil), you probably won't even now Dr Wily is supposed to be helping you.  Granted, the game is longer than the other titles, so maybe they didn't have the memory to work with on extra cut scenes, given the NES's technical limitations.  Still, given how it's the best story it's sad Capcom relied almost entirely on the game manual, which most NES players won't have access too, to advance the story.2. Top Man.  He's the most stupid robot master of the first three games, and his weapon is hard to figure out how to use.  Once you do figure it out, its pretty useless with the sole exception of the last boss fight.  The whole idea of \"Top Man\" as a robot master is pretty ridiculous, and is the first indication in the Classic Series that Capcom is beginning to run out of ideas for robot masters.  This trend of borderline asinine robot masters would continue thru \"Mega Man IV\" and \"Mega Man 5\", and reach the absolute bottom of the barrel in \"Mega Man 6\"(really, who the HELL thought of \"Plant Man\"?)  A minor quibble, though, and don't let that distract you from all the game has to offer.  It's a more important as an indicator of bad things to come for the series than really effecting this game's quality.  Beginning cracks in the foundation, if you will.Overall, I think this is easily one of Mega Man's best games, and is an essential purchase for NES and retro gamers, as well as Mega Man fans.  As much as I like \"Mega Man II\", I really think \"Mega Man III\" gives it a run for its money.Though \"Mega Man II\" is more important from a franchise historical pov as it was his first major hit game (\"Mega Man\" was more of a sleeper hit), \"Mega Man III\" takes everything about \"Mega Man II\" and improves on it.  This one definitely ups the ante, and the next three sequels simply can't compare it its genius or playability.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of Mega Man's all time great games on any system, probably even better than Mega Man II", "unixReviewTime": 1193443200, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2007"}

Sliding was introduced in this game which gave Megaman a new way to play not seen before (it was taken out in Megaman 9 + 10 for some reason). With this new control, speed runs are really there, you can get under areas to get items with overall control being perfect.The main question people wonder about old NES games is, is it fun? Well, you put this game in your NES, you might as well just leave it in there because you will want to revisit this game any chance you get! Selecting any stage you want and playing them in any order was a fantastic idea. Silver Surfer had that idea, but I won't get into that game. All the stages are vastly different from each other with each having their own catchy tunes. I actually gave this soundtrack a perfect score whereas other Megaman games did not receive a perfect score. I love Topman's theme and Dr. Wily stage musics the best. It is so perfectly in place. This was the first Megaman game to have sub-bosses in the series. For example, in Topman's stage, you will run through the level for a little bit where you come to a stop and battle a large stationary cat that doesn't take too many hits (about 15 I think) and proceed to the rest of the level. The sub-bosses never took long to beat which is good because it keeps the pace moving rapidly. A very important key factor in a videogame is to make the player never feel like they have to sit there and wait for the game. That is annoying. Each stage has it own atmosphere to make you believe you are really where you are. The first Megaman game had a little bit of that, but not too much. Megaman 2 was better (particularly with Flashman). The bosses all have their own patterns that are very easy to figure out, but may take a couple of tries for first-timers. The nice thing about this is that they are difficult the first time, but you are not going to sit there and waste all your lives on 1 boss because you don't know what to do.Many people criticize classic games for \"bad graphics\", one note on that, that was the best they had when the graphics engine released in 1983, give them a break. The graphics actually are very well drawn and it is all bright and colorful.How do you get 11/10 on control? Here is how. The control is already perfect, but in this game, the programmers left the debug cheat in it that allows you to freeze animations. You can freeze enemies in place, walk off of the screen and not die, and jump super-high. Press UP on P2 to freeze enemies and bosses. Press RIGHT on P2 to walk off the stage and jump ultra high. Also, this is the only game with Rush Jet that you can control him 100%. In Megaman 4, when you call Rush and jump on him, he locks in that direction and speed. Here, you can change direction, stop, and sometimes go slightly off screen.Boss difficulties and basic strategies (best order):Needleman - 8/10, Throughout the level, you will get an E-Tank. If he jumps towards you, slide under him and fire. If he jumps straight up, he will shoot homing needles at you, just rapidly jump and fire.Snakeman - 3/10, You can walk in the just keep firing. You really don't have to move. Just jump over the snakes.Geminiman - 7/10, He splits into 2. Select Snake Search and turn left. Throw 3 snakes to kill the first one, then go fire happy to finish the second one.Topman - 2/10, He goes from side to side and throws 3 tops at you, jump over him, keep firing, dodge the tops, repeat.Shadowman - 8/10, Select Top Spin and use it next to him in the air and slightly above him.Magnetman - 7/10, No real strategy, just select Shadow Blade and shoot him when he comes near.Hardman - 7/10, Select Magnet Missle fire 1 per second, he will jump at you and dive. Avoid him. Repeat.Sparkman - 7/10, Select Shadow Blade and shoot him as he jumps around firing spark shots.After completing the bosses, you will revisit 4 selected stages to revisit where you will encounter some familiar faces which was the only Megaman game ever to do that! All the stages are stages you have played before, but vastly modified. Even now, they throw a surprise at you battling a friend or foe situation which is also very cool. The doctor Wily stages and robot masters of these stages are all so radically different from each other and different from any other Megaman game. Even the last boss was nothing like any other Megaman game. Note that in this game, Dr Wily is spelled liked Dr. Wiley. It was the only Megaman game to make that mistake as well.Final comment would be, if you have an NES, GET THIS GAME!!! You will not be disappointed. This is THE game to have in your collection.

Actually, you soon find out that it's an elaborate [plan] to frame the horribly underrated \"older\" brother of the blue bomber, and so here begins my review of Mega Man's fifth adventure on the NES.THE GOODThe storyline is actually among the best in the series and it allows a refreshing change to the normal \"Dr. Wily's at it again, let's get him!\" storyline. Proto Man actually has a substantial role in the plot and I believe him to be a very underused character (Capcom, MAKE HIM HIS OWN GAME.). Beat is also introduced in this game and he's quite useful. This game is the only game that allows him to attack bosses (and makes Wily at the end seem like a walk in the park!). The game is thankfully a bit more difficult than 2,3, and 4 with the evil \"Darkman\" stages. The graphics are also better and the backgrounds even have parallax to them.THE BADThis game has a more powerful \"Mega Buster,\" but every time you get hit, you have to start the charge over again. This wasn't that huge of a deal, but I wish they would've kept it more like MM4's Mega Buster. Also, the music is mostly mediocre with only a handful of tunes that are really memorable.OVERALLWhile not a bad game, I find it hard to rank it above the first four games. It doesn't -quite- touch the first four in terms of charm and the good, old fashioned \"Mega Man feel.\" I really can't explain it, and perhaps if it had better music, it would've been better. The game doesn't connect well with the others at all, which is quite a shame. My feelings on this game are very mixed, but I still recommend at least playing it through.

MM5 has plenty of really cool features and mainly focuses on an outer space-type level design.  This is one thing that caught my attention immediately back in the day.I remember 20 years ago when my mom would rent this game for me.  I did poorly back then.  I was able to complete exactly ONE stage, and now I can't even remember which stage it was!  Ah, a trip down memory lane when video games meant the absolute world to me.  Back then I considered Mega Man games *enormously* difficult.  This was a couple years before the X series came out.  I was totally confused and needed help to figure out which stages/bosses I was supposed to battle first.  For some reason I had trouble figuring this out and didn't have a Nintendo Power in my possession to help me.  Even though I was subscribing back then, I never had the issues that would help me through these Mega Man games.  The good news is that the challenge seems more understandable and less intimidating as an adult, however.Anyway, yeah, these levels are really colorful for an NES game.  A graphical and background-filled upgrade in comparison to MM4, but probably only a slight one.  One stage even has the jet ski!  Talk about cool.  I didn't think the NES had the ability to use it without the play control slowing down significantly due to the speed and the amount of enemies going by the screen, but I was wrong- it flows near flawlessly.  One thing's for absolute sure- you HAVE to have the correct weapon in your inventory when entering a boss fight.  Having the right weapon hasn't been this important since the very first Mega Man game (and it was VERY important in that game).  Also make sure you don't accidentally enter the fight without enough weapon energy or you'll pay in the worst way!The music is really good this time around, but probably not quite as memorable as the themes from MM4.  Even though as an adult I find the challenge level more bearable, it doesn't change the fact that the game is still rock hard.  You *will* lose plenty of lives so be prepared for that, and there is a degree of practice required in pushing your way through these stages successfully by experimenting with the right weapons and avoiding all the dangerous traps (of which there's many).  This is what the X games lack, however.  In the MMX games it doesn't really matter how you get through the stages because you'll probably survive no matter what due to the generosity of health energy scattered everywhere and enemies normally being less threatening.  Not so here.  I like MM5 though, because it reminds me of a good old-fashioned arcade experience.  Raw, relentless and sometimes aggravating.

At this point, it was more of the same for the Blue Bomber as the concept of defeating robot after robot was starting to wear out its novelty but it was still worth a look to see what Robots were featured and what the story would be this time around.The city is under attack. Robots go on a rampage while Dr. Light ended up being kidnapped by Proto Man. Dr. Cossack warns Mega Man and he soon takes off to get Dr. Light, only to see that Proto Man was set up from the get go and Dr. Wily ultimately emerges to challenge Mega Man: go to his castle and fight him in order to save Dr. Light. Just like the previous four games, you pick a Robot Master's stage, explore it and defeat the Robot Master to acquire his special weapon. Then, repeat the process until all eight Robot Masters are defeated. Go through Proto Man's impostor's castle and finally, play through Dr. Wily's castle to save Dr. Light. In addition to collecting the special weapons, you picked up health and weapons capsules as well as 1ups. Rush returns to help you out, your Mega Buster from Mega Man 4 returns but is more powerful now. And for the first time, you meet Beat, a robotic bird that saved you whenever you fell into a pit.

In all honesty, I thought it was ludicrous that I was paying more for it than I did for a copy of the 1987 original. Nothing in that respect has changed, but I'll be damned if Mega Man 5 didn't pull the rug out from under me despite partaking of previous, seemingly uneventful play throughs.As the title suggests, Mega Man 5 is an uneven beast when it comes to difficulty. Fun as it still is figuring out the \"weakness chain\" it takes next to nothing to get through the initial robot master crew and their levels. This and the overall feel of the game changes dramatically once the player enters the fortress levels. There's an abstract sense of maturity that presides over this portion of the game, something that reminds me of the sobering steel and seriousness of a Mega Man X game.Interesting as this can be, the most significant change Mega Man 5 brings to the table is the fact the series has finally cleared that oddball hump that started with Mega Man 3 and continued with Mega Man 4. Even after playing through the NES Mega Man games I still can't explain why these particular titles feel as bizarre as they do. Needless to say, I was glad to see things were back on track despite the fact Mega Man 5 doesn't deviate from the tired and true formula.While I can't say I was exactly thrilled with the price tag it carries, Mega Man 5 is a lot better than a quick glance, or a half-remembered memory would suggest.

Of the last three games (MM4 thru MM6), this is pretty much neck and neck with MM4 in terms of quality.  Good game, but it has that whole we've been here done that feeling that drags the whole enterprise down.  It's yet another remake with the same gameplay of the first MEGA MAN.The plotline of this one (like NES games really need plots, but I digress) is Proto Man has gone bad, set himself up as the new current megalomaniac trying to take over the world, and programmed eight robot masters to be evil (why is it always 8?)  Maybe Rincewind has a right to fear that number (sorry, Terry Prachet Discworld reference).  If the plot feels a little overfamiliar, that's  because it's the same as MM IV.  And just like MM IV, it turns out when you fight Proto Man that Dr Wiley was behind it all and you must fight him.You played the other Mega Man games.  You know the drill.  Select a robot master, see what weapon can beat him by beating other roboatmasters, beat all 8, proceed to Proto Man.Fortunately there aren't as many tired or rehashed ideas in Mega Man 5 as far as level design and bosses go, unlike Mega Man 6.  The Robot Masters are fairly original, especially Gravity Man, Napalm Man, and Charge Man.  Charge Man has a nice railroad themed level.  Crystal Man is a little like Gemini Man from III.  Still, the game's level design is pretty good for the NES.  Gravity Man and Star Man have fun stages, and they're pretty innovative for Mega Man.Another new feature of the game is each stage has one letter, which you must obtain to get the robotic bird Beat.  You need Beat to beat Dr Wiley at the end, because if you don't it'll be really hard.  The letters spell out MEGA MAN V, and they are part of the challenge of the game to get obtain them.  Trust me, when you get to the end battle, you'll be thankful you took the time to collect those eight letters.We also get a new an improved mega buster, even though when it is charging if you get hit you will lose the charge as well, which sucks royally.  We also get a new weapon called the Super Arrow, which is pretty cool as well.The challenge is up there. While not damn near impossible like the original MEGA MAN, MM5 has its fair share of challenging sections, but if you persist you will come to the end of the journey.There are some flaws in the title.  Capcom changed the Rush Coil, much to its detriment.  Passwords don't save everything, which really sucks. The Super Arrow is an interesting idea but not very well implemented.  The storyline is the same as IV.The biggest damage this game has caused is how it confused a lot of people about Proto Man.  They think he is evil, but is in fact a good guy.  Naturally, Dr Wiley is behind this, and the storyline is just like MM IV.Of the Fake Villain or Fake Bad Guy Trilogy, as I refer to Mega Man 4-6, this is pretty strong, and for oldschool platform fans there's a lot to recommend to Mega Man 5.  The real problem with Mega Man 4-6 is that everything it does, the first trilogy does better, and the first three games are a lot fresher, before Capcom drove the series into the ground with endless sequels.  MM5 is good, but only play it after you played the first three games.This is my order of Mega Man NES titles from best to worst.  II and III are the best, though I give a slight edge to II because this is the game that really redefined the Mega Man formula, but III is just as good.  IV and V are about the same as well, though neither approach the sublime quality of the first three.MEGA MAN IIMEGA MAN IIIMEGA MANMEGA MAN VMEGA MAN IVMEGA MAN VI.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Brother Betrayed (or) More of the Same", "unixReviewTime": 1193356800, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2007"}

But compared to all the other Mega Mans on the same console, this one just wasn't worth it for most fans. I lost hope when I heard that this just wasn't good enough. Fortunately for me, I loved it as much as the rest.While the music doesn't sound too lively, the series' signature graphics and basic gameplay still shine through greatly. Unfortunately, the gameplay has been hampered by the fact that most of the bosses' powers are terrible. The Power Stone misses everything, the Charge Kick rarely does anything, Star Man's stars are worthless in most cases, and the list would go on. Whatever you do, just stick with your regular power. Even Rush isn't so great here.Although you do have to face those flaws, that still doesn't mean the overall game is bad. The level design is still just as creative as in the other games, and there's still a good challenge in the game. Speaking of challenge, that is kinda lowered down, too. You get a bigger chance of getting extra lives and health restorers. That way, both newbies and long-time Mega Man fans can enjoy the game. I also like how you have to collect M-E-G-A-M-A-N-V letters for a little something extra.

Mega Man naturally speeds to the rescue, but what may sound like an awesome game turned out to be a mere effort, unfortunately. Read on to see why Mega Man's last adventure on NES was not a &quot;one shot at glory&quot;:THE GOODWe get two new Rush adaptors (Power and Jet) that kick major arse. You'll find that using them is ten times more fun than using the acquired boss weapons! The music is also thankfully better (although it DOESN'T TOUCH the first four... get to that in THE BAD) and we get more robotmasters and more Wily stages to bash through. Some of the robotmasters are quite unique, especially Tomahawkman and Yamatoman.THE BADThe storyline is TOO similar to Mega Man 4's, and this game pulls it off to a lesser extent. The &quot;Mr. X&quot; disguise didn't fool me at all. While the music was definitely better than the 5th game's, a lot of it is really odd; it just didn't sound like Mega Man. The graphics were also a letdown from 5's parallax graphics, and even some of the sprites (ex.: Mega Man climbing up looks really funky) look rather static. It's clear that this is the last NES game released (to my knowledge), but I think Capcom could've done better. Another aspect of the game that really bothered me was the simplicity of the stages (and the game's insanely easy difficulty).OVERALLI really am mixed about this game. For the longest time, I really liked this one over 5 because it seemed to be more fun. Now, after judging the two games from today's standpoint, I liked 5 better overall because it was harder, the gameplay was a bit smoother (not to mention Beat was ten times better), and the storyline is among the best in the series. This game has great ideas like the Rush adaptors, the Energy Equalizer (I think that's what it's called), better music, and interesting bosses. So basically, if you mashed the two together, you'd get all the Mega Man qualities. Seriously, though, I think Capcom really rushed this one and it shows... And, so, with strenous decision-making, I'd have to say that 5 is better by a notch. Oh man, this game comes SOOOO close.

You could release 20 games in this same exact style and if I like the idea, I'll continue to play.However Mega Man 6 does have some minor issues.  The biggest being the emptiness you occasionally encounter in some of the stages.  It's more like large sections that feel like filler to dash through, which is a shame.  It reveals that Capcom was indeed running out of ideas by this point and simply putting MM6 on the market because it's Mega Man and it'd sell on the name alone.  The bosses aren't nearly as threatening as previous games either.  About half of them can be completed with little trouble, while the more aggressives one can be taken down by dashing around like crazy.  Not a problem however.  Easiness is rather encouraging after the struggles I had in, say, Mega Man 4.Pretty catchy music but nothing that blows me away.  The weapons are decent enough, but again, I can take or leave them.  Probably the most noticeable sign that Capcom was running low on ideas is, if you've ever played Mega Man X3, there's a Blast Rhino and Volt Catfish stage.  These two stages have similar enemies and design as a couple from THIS game.

But the NES was still cranking out games whether gamers liked it or not. For those who had the SNES, Capcom released Mega Man X and was very well received by critics and gamers. In 1994, they released the last entry in the NES Mega Man series with Mega Man 6. Incidentally, Capcom was too busy making Mega Man X and Mega Man 6 at the time so they let Nintendo publish the game for them. While it brought a few new ideas as well as the standard run and gun game play, the last NES Mega Man game left a lot to be desired.Mega Man 6 started off with a robot tournament in full swing that got taken over by Mr. X. He took control of the eight most powerful robot entries and let them run wild in the city. Mega Man swings into action to stop him once and for all. Of course, it doesn't take long to realize Mr. X was Dr. Wily in disguise, so you have eight stages to choose from and two castles to explore, each with 4 stages for a total of 16 stages. You know the drill: pick a stage, beat the Robot Master and get his weapon to use on another Robot Master. To mix things up a bit, the Robot Masters were created by fans of the series, not by Capcom. Some of the stages have alternate paths where one leads to the Robot Master while the other leads to a \"fake\" version of the Robot Master. Mega Man can now combine powers with his dog Rush after you collect two Rush adapters. Of course, the robot bird Beat from Mega Man 5 returns and will help you once you collect the letters that spell out his name. When you want to take a break, you can write down a password so you can continue your game later.The PROS: It was nice for Capcom to finally try to shake up the traditional formula it followed with all of their Mega Man games. It looked and played like the games before it. The music, while not as strong as what you heard in Mega Man 5, still sounded good. The controls remain untouched so they still work.The CONS: Previous Mega Man games looked better than Mega Man 6. Even though the Robot Masters are the creations of the contest winners, Capcom could have picked better choices. Most of the Robot Masters were based on elements that were already seen (water, ice, fire, air) so that created a sense of redundancy. Judging from the stage layouts, you could tell that Capcom was running out of ideas.With the release of Mega Man 6, the series came to a close on the NES but continued on the Super NES with Mega Man 7. Capcom would move forward with the Mega Man X series. Some people liked Mega Man 6 while others were disappointed because it really didn't bring anything new to the series.

Really, some of the best 8 bit games arrived at the end such as Kirby's adventure and this game right here.Capcom didn't have enough faith in the blue bomber to release this in the U.S. so Nintendo went ahead and published this themselves. At this point with all of the sequels already out, everyone knew what to expect from a new megaman game, a quality well balanced game. There aren't any really new ideas and the formula is pretty much the same as the other five but if it ain't broke?One big change is that Rush (mega's robot dog) is effectively gone. He combines with megaman to transform into cool powers that help you progress such as a punch that crashes through obstacles and a jetpack that lets you accelerate into the sky to reach places you otherwise would be unable to get to. You also get the powers of the defeated robot masters like before and they are actually useful this time unlike the last couple entries of the series. You can collect parts to create a bird sidekick that helps you fight but it's not really required to finish the game, instead it gives you some incentive to replay levels you've already passed.The graphics and sound are top notch here and are on par with what you would expect from an nes capcom game. Everything is beautifully animated and the colorful backdrop is almost super nintendo quality.The robot masters and their levels are challenging but never too hard and are well designed. The game really plays around with gravity by creating springs and fans that throw you all over the place. Another nice touch is when you replay the levels, they change in subtle ways. For example, in tomahawk man's level, the first time through there's a full sun in the background but when you come back there's a sunset and the color altogether has changed. The music is another a highlight although the tunes aren't quite as memorable as the first three, they still rock anyway.Overall, this is a great game. Every Megaman fan always debates which is better, part 3 or part 2 and this game really doesn't match those two. While not as spectacular as the first three, this is still much better than part 4 and it retains some of the difficuly that was lost in part 5.

While it's hard to deny the series was running out of gas by this point - just take a look at some of the robot masters - there were several things that managed to grab my attention. The most important additions in Mega Man 6 have to be the Rush adapters that grant the player the ability to turn into Jet and Power Mega Man. These forms allow the player to reach previously inaccessible areas and help bring back a little of the exploration that's been slightly siphoned out of the games over the years.Welcome as adapters are, they can also show one how sloppy the game can be. The first eight stages of the game play like a dream and I have no complaints. It's only after the player enters the final two fortresses do we see where how ugly things can get when game's challenges are not tackled the right way. Things are entertaining and a breeze with the right weapons/form in hand, but this slick veneer is quickly peeled away when the player is caught between a rock and a hard place. Even with advance knowledge of what's ahead it's amazing how easy it is for this to occur.Still, like the family pet the fails to do its business outside, it's hard to stay mad at Mega Man 6.

Capcom wanted to move Mega Man to the SNES, but before doing so, they made a final chapter for everyone's favorite blue bomber.Ironically enough, Capcom chose not to release MEGA MAN VI in the United States, publishing the game only in Japan, due to their decision to put their efforts behind the new MEGA MAN X series.  When Capcom informed Nintendo of this decision, Nintendo took it upon themselves to publish the game in America, which is why the game was never released in Europe.How does it stand up to the other five games?  Actually, not that bad.  It's obvious Capcom is running out of ideas.  The basic story is that a mysterious Mr. X (gee, I wonder who that could be) has been setting up a robot tournament, and when Mega Man shows up, all the robots turn against Mega Man and Mr X tries to take over the world.  Naturally, when you defeat Mr X, turns out it is Dr. Wiley and you have to go into a second castle.  While Mega Man IV and V at least at an element of surprise in their \"twist\" ending, by VI you can tell it's Wiley from the beginning, even kinda looks like him.First off, the graphics are top notch, and so is the sound.  But that is little surprise as Mega Man always had great graphics for the NES.Capcom was so bereft of ideas They even had contestant winners in Nintendo Power design two of the robot bosses (Wind Man, designed by Michael Leader of the US, and Knight Man, designed by Daniel Vallie of Canada).The other six bosses are largely retreads of previous robot masters or just plain ridiculous.We have Plant Man (who, might I add, is the single worst boss in not only Mega Man, but in all of video games - he's just gay).  His (lame) weapon is a flower shield, and basically he's a poor boy version of the superior Leaf Man from MEGA MAN II.  We have Blizzard Man, who for whatever reason is on skis.  Ripoff of Air Man from II and Ice Man from the first game.  Flame Man is yet another heat-based robot master (we've already had Fire Man from I, Heat Man from II, and Napalm Man from V).  We have Tomahawk Man, who is very formidable, but still feels out of place and like Capcom was really stretching for ideas.  Centaur Man is at least somewhat imaginative. The worst, though, is Yamato Man.  Apparently Yamato is a geographical term in Japan.  It'd be like Oxford Man or Birmingshire Man or Las Vegas Man.  Incomprehensible.  Stupid.  Even Wind Man, who was designed by one of the contestant winners, is little more than another version of Air Man.The levels themselves, while compentant, are hardly what you call inspired.  A lot of them you have seen before in previous incarnations, especially Flame Man's level (come on, we've had fire-themed levels before).A bad part of the levels is that four of them have false endings, I guess in attempts from Capcom to give the game more replayability. In each of the levels for Tomahawk Man, Yamato Man, Knight Man, and Centaur Man, two separate boss chambers appear, one more difficult to reach than the other.  By accessing the more difficult of the two you get one of four letters (B, E, A, T), and when you get all four you can now use Beat, the robotic bird from Mega Man V.  Quite frankly, the fake endings are rather dumb.The last levels have some engaging moments, even though one of the castle bosses (a big dragon) is a little too similar too the boss dragon of Mega Man II for my comfort.  There's another stage in the Wiley's castle which is primarily dirty water and those spiked orbs, which is again a throw back to Mega Man II.The end features Dr Wiley being thrown in jail, with the last words and a newspaper picture printed.  The ending provides good closure for the series, but then Capcom spoils that by saying \"To be continued\".  Still a good way to close the NES leg of Mega Man's journey as far as story-wise goes.Mega Man also has some new features.  Taking a page from Mario, he has a rush adapter that allows him to fly (albeit, pretty briefly).  This is featured prominently on the game art.  Beat returns.  I would like to have flown longer, given how much this was hyped.Is MEGA MAN VI a good game? Yes.  Without a doubt.  It would be an even better game its five predecessors did not exist.  Because ultimately, even though they tried adding some new things to the Mega Man formula, at the end of the day, Capcom with this title feels tired and uninspired, like they trying to squeeze one more dollar out of the Mega Man franchise.  But that's largely because MEGA MAN VI is just more of the same.  If you like the formula you'll love this title.  But it is still very formulaic.All the NES Mega Man games are good, but they're largely the same.  I'd go with II or III first, but if you haven't played any Mega Man games VI is a good place to start.

Handgun, machine gun, rocket launcher, grenade launcher, mines, etc. There is also a large variety of items like oxygen tanks, door cards, cardboard box, rations, etc. The door card system is annoying, though, because you have 10 cards or so, and you have to patiently go through each one of them to find out which one opens what door.

The original Ninja Gaiden is still one of the best titles available on the NES. Games of this era were generally quite hard, since sheer difficulty was generally the main way a developer created replay value. That said, this game is as hard--perhaps harder at times--as Ghosts n' Goblins, making it arguably one of the toughest games out there. Unlike Gn'G, though, this difficulty is due to the tightly patterned design of the levels and enemy attacks that must be faced rather than randomness or poor programming.For such a small program (256K,) this title does a highly recommendable job with the graphics. Stylish, very well orchestrated and designed cutscenes make the most of tight restrictions; the title screen is quite impressive for the NES as it leads right into the cutscene as a good movie might. Most levels are packed with layered scrolling backgrounds giving a great sense of depth, though this isn't evident from playing the first level (a rather odd version of late 1980s America, complete with biker guys wielding clubs and gun-toting punk rockers). It is easy to see how some might consider this a Castlevania ripoff--coming slightly more than two years after the original 1986 Famicom Disk System version of that game, this one has a sidescrolling perspective, special weapons work in a similar way and, most importantly, are often found inside lanterns! It is a very shallow comparison, however. Ninja Gaiden has you leaping all about the place with stunning speed--you grasp walls and bounce off street signs to get to high places, and the general emphasis is on getting There, wherever that might be, instead of beating whatever is in your way to bits.Sound is actually quite good. Across the board there are a couple outstanding tunes, and you won't be getting any headaches soon from this game's music.This game (even more than most 16 bit titles) has a sense of scale and depth that few others even begin to compete with. Ninja Gaiden moves you across the world on a quest of such scale that it's hard to put a finger on it--demons, the CIA, and traditional Japanese virtue all have their place here.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Cinematics on your NES!

In fact, Tecmo took a page from the book of another successful action-platformer of the day, Konami's Castlevania, and mimicked its special weapon system almost to a tee.

The current-day Ninja Gaidens have a reputation for being overly-difficult, but it was this NES original that initially set the trend. In addition to exceptionally hard feats of platforming, Ninja Gaiden's fast and furious action was made all the more difficult by its vast army of wily enemies.

Awsome job tecmo, not even ninja gaidens sequels had music as good a this. For those who played Contra on the nes, ya its all here.Gameplay- You are a swift, agile, steady ninja who must manage thru levels without falling into pits (mostly enemies fault cuz you get knocked back like in castlevania) and stay alive with a boss to fight at the end of the stage, only the later bosses are tricky. You get a magic thing called ninpo. This allows you to get different ninpo such as art of fire wheel to a cool sword flip maneuver in the air. You can only use them so many times due to how much ninpo you have to use (when you use ninpo, your ninpo thingy goes down) so you need to collect ninpo in levels.You basically need to time your attacks with your trusty katana or you may find yourself dead in an instant (those evil birds and bats ahh dang).Final Comments- I never beat this game cuz i was stuck on last boss and when you die on him, you start like 5 LEVELS BACK!

No, it isn't, but how they played it probably made it too tough to play. For me, I took the wimp route and beat it without a problem. No, it's not a Game Genie that was used. Listen up, follow this simple strategy, and it will work for you. Notice in the game how you are able to advance to the next day if you have enough white houses. Then...that's how you beat the game. Get it? No? Ok...fine. Theoretically and basically, you will advance to the next day if you have at least one white house standing on the route. Pretty much, who cares about the fact that you either make 10 out of 10 perfectly or miss a ton of them? As long as you make one perfect delivery to a house, you are good to go for the next day. That's exactly how you should play the game. So, here is my perfect strategy in terms of beating Paperboy: forget about racking up points by throwing tons of papers, forget about throwing papers to every white house in hopes for gaining a house next day unless you have no fear of being run over by an obstacle, focus on making a perfect run avoiding all obstacles along the way without losing a life, and just hit the two of the easiest houses on the route. The game is much, much harder if you juggle through hitting white houses as perfectly as you can, riding the bike in an aligned manner, avoiding obstacles side and front, and picking up newspapers. I pretty much focused on aligning my bike perfectly as I can and just worked on the same two houses every day. I don't even care about the training course since it doesn't affect my lives. I prefer to crash once I am in there, just to save my hands from getting sore. That's how the game is easy for me to beat. I actually survived the whole thing with one house left (another one was added on Sunday for a \"perfect\" delivery), making the entire game a joke. Even the farewell part was lunatic to observe, seeing how laughably I missed so many houses yet I won. That's how bad the game is. I know Paperboy has been regarded as a classic back then, but let's get real...the game sucks. Anybody can beat it if my simple strategy is followed. Otherwise, tough game and not worth attempting.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "I Am Gonna Run This Paperboy Over with a Mack Truck!", "unixReviewTime": 1296950400, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2011"}

The stages are varied, and have memorable boss battles.  Overall the game is on the easy side, which is wholly appropriate for the market this game was aimed for.  Unlike other titles like \"Battletoads\" and \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", there are no difficulty spikes that render the game almost unplayble.  The boss battles, like the rest of the game, are on the easy side and are wholly enjoyableAfter beating the initial level, you are presented with a world map with each level marked as a letter (A-G).  The bare minimum that must be played to reach Fat Cat, the game's final boss, is actually seven levels.  You can beat the game in a mere seven levels, completely bypassing four levels.  The shortest route to Fat Kat is skipping A and C and going to Level B, then D, then F, then G.  E is an optional level.After beating G, you are taken to a second section of the World Map, with levels H, I, and J ahead of you.The game is short and won't take you long to beat. However there is some extended life in the game by the great co-op play present in the title.  I rented this game back in the late 1980s when it came out and first played the game with a cousin of mind - and let me tell you, that was a lot of fun.  The game is so much better with two players.Nintendo talks about how they wanted to get co-op Mario as early as SMB3 but weren't able too.  Don't know why, because there are plenty of co-op experiences on the NES, and this is one of the better ones.This (short) game also appeared as a feature article and on the cover of \"Nintendo Power\".  I remember renting (and subsequently buying) this game on the strength of the co-op gameplay, as both players, one controlling Chip and the Dale, can have game bonding together.The video game website IGN rated this title as the 71th greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.(For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games, you simply MUST play \"Moon Crystal\", a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive.

Then in 1988 Konami released the title in the PAL region and America under the title \"Rush'n Attack.\"Ah, the age of the Red Scare.  It does well to remember historically that this title was released in the late 1980s, when Ronald Regan was battling the \"Evil Empire\" and the Russians and the Cold War loomed heavy on the hearts and minds of American.Naturally, all this awareness makes a built in market for products such as video games where your goal is to fight communists and beat back Russians holding POWs.  Rush N Attack is a side scroller, with hordes of enemies attacking your character.  And unlike its title suggest, the best way to proceed through this game is cautiously.Overall, the game feels very much like a rough draft version of CONTRA.  I would not be surprised if the two titles had the same development team.  The gameplay is very similar (identical, really); however, RUSH N ATTACK does not have the memorable levels that CONTRA does.  Also, at most, there are only two different heights of ground (upper level and lower level) throughout RUSH's stages, whereas CONTRA you can have several different platforms heights you can play with.  CONTRA also allows you to shoot in several different directions.Strangely, like most games of the era, even though the main character is military, the US Military sends in the main solider of the game vastly underarmed.  The game stars a faceless American solider armed with a knife (why don't the military games of the 1980s include more than a knife???) and who can pick up guns and rocket launchers.  However, with all the enemies I guarantee you you won't last long without careful memorization and quick, catlike reflexes.The story is simple.  Free POWs.  Destroy the secret weapon the Russians are planning to use to destory the world (just like Iran and their grab for nuclear weapons of today).Konami released \"Rush'n Attack\" as an arcade title under the name \"Green Beret\" in 1987 in Japan and also as a Famicom Disk System title. Then in 1988 Konami released the title in the PAL region and America under the title \"Rush'n Attack.\"There are numerous differences between the three different versions. In the arcade title, there are only four stages, as opposed to the FDS and NES game which had six, and the goal of the game was free POWs. In the NES version, the POWs were removed and the goal was to destroy the enemie's secret weapon. Also a flame thrower from the arcade title was removed from the NES version and the NES featured two power ups not present in the arcade title: a star and and a pistol with unlimited ammo, both of which have a time limit.Also, in Stage Six, there is a secret underground passage present in the FDS version that is not found in the NES version.\"Rush'n Attack\" is one of those games I had growing up a kid. Like Rambo, I always wondered why they only equip the main hero with only a knife, to fight off hoards of enemies. The game can be rather challenging. Like most NES games, \"Rush'n Attack\" is on the short side. Also the end boss (a giant missile with hordes of enemies attacking you) is rather bizarre as you destroy this giant missile by repeatedly stabbing the explosive with your knife. Didn't know you could destroy missiles that way.Overall, decent for an NES title, nothing to write home about today.

It's a real fun game where you look for keys in all sorts of weird places, read scrolls to obtain spells, get parts for the staff so you can kill the beast at the end of the game. I got a lot of fun finding the sphere so I can take it to the room with the shark infested waters which has the skeleton that has that key. I drop the sphere in the water and I can safely grab the key without being killed by the shark. Another favorite of mine is when you stick a rod by the stairways, lightening strikes it, a skeleton hand reaches out of the ground and you received the wand which you need when you end up in the room with the snake across the broken bridge. I don't want to spoil it all, but for 8-bit NES, the graphics are way cool, and the game is really fun to play.

So you enter Castle Shadowgate in order to seek out the Warlok Lord and end his reign. Of coarse, nothing come easy. You encounter dangerous beasts, ghosts, and if you fail, death himself. You also have to solve mind-bending puzzles, which is the main appeal of this game. You have to rely more on your brains and wits rather than your sword. The game is quite difficult the first time through, and will definitely keep you busy for a few days at least. But there in lies the big flaw in \"Shadowgate\". There is no replay value. Once you have beaten the game, you know all the secrets and can easily breeze through the second time around. I beat this game in two weeks, but the second time I beat it in less than 45 minutes. But considering the age of this game, it is not a huge downer. It is still a fun trip down memory lane.In terms of graphics, they are great by NES standards. The colors and textures add depth to any given situation, while the music also compliments the mood.

I've beaten the game with the genie and also without the genie, but, in neither way, it was that easy. The first, but all-important, level is pretty easy with plenty of practice, but the hardest part of it is right at the beginning where you need to jump on the trash can to grab the 1-Up without touching the jumping mutant. Make absolutely sure to grab every Ups in this level as much as possible. I believe that there are about 6 Ups for a total of 8 lives (one before the Wet paint sign, one after the phone booth, one in the bushes during skateboarding, and one at the K sign for 3 Ups). Be sure to grab all coins as possible, and only get 1 cherry bomb and 5 rockets. Be sure to get a magnet which will be useful in level 3. The second level is very challenging, and a few lives will be lost in this one. Make sure to jump up and down many times on each trash can. After something comes out, be sure to do it again. One trash can is very special as it really gives 5 bonus offerings at 5 separate times. After a while, this level is pretty easy yet you will lose a few lives. Also, most people do not realize that, you notice that cement thing and there are rotating lollipops over it? Actually, the whole thing isn't even necessary. At the second up-and-down board over the cement pit, all you got to do is jump on it three times, and it will become a floating device, letting you to skip everything in sight. A huge lifesaver, yes. The third level can be viewed difficult for a while, but it gets pretty easy with some practice. The carnival games are all-important, and be sure to win them all. The magnet is used for the number game where you activate it before the game is started for cheating. At the diving tower, you could always do it over and over for lots of coins, thus more lives. But it gets boring after a while. So I routinely skip it. Probably the hardest part of level 3 is the hot air walk which can be difficult to master. However, this is my trick. When you are initially at the top of the pipe, I count 1..2..3 before I move to the right. Keep doing the counting trick because really, it has been very successful for me. It is worth the effort to jump into Krusty's mouth when you get to the top because there is a bonus room giving 15 coins plus 1-Up. The rest of the way gets easier with the exception of the Ferris wheel. So, be sure to use the A + B as soon as you see the first cart appear. In my opinion, I would skip the center for 1-Up and go straight right ahead and finish it off because the wheel is just hard enough. The fourth level appears...wow...it's the most difficult level of the whole game. It's that brutally hard and very difficult to master. I died in that level so many times that I needed the genie to work on that very often just to master parts of it. The most difficult at first is the jumping part in the jungle, especially on the crocodiles on the pond. That's a really hard part. Then, the jumping monkey...difficult as hell until the gun is reached. Then the hardest part comes...the lava jumping and the popping blocks jumping. When all are mastered, the level isn't even over yet. We got so many difficult obstacles left to go. The rock falling...then Bart got to jump over the floating rock, and then he got to jump over 14 dinosaur bones. This one was really hard for me because of the stupid birds getting in the way. Remember this tip, when there is a moment that the bird will fly down in an arch movement, make sure to jump back to the previous bone and wait for it to fly out, and then you can keep going. The second bird that does it, just stay where you are and wait for the bird to complete the arch. Honestly, it is just as best to preserve two hits before facing the huge dinosaur head. He is pretty easy to defeat, and all you have to do it jump over on 2 ledges before getting on the head. Once there, you can just wait for it to spit fire before you can go back and hit his head again. After him, the level gets pretty easy thereon. The fifth level is the easiest of the whole game...thank goodness. My suggestion to you is to draw a map, showing 5 levels. Then you just mark the walls, switch walls, elevators, and doors because if you do not do this, you will not win the game...period. The 16th rod only can be found when you approach Maggie when you have found all 15 of them already and you just push B to end the game. Wow...I honestly have to say...The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants is one of the hardest games in NES history, and this game is that brutally challenging. A lot of gamers will attest to this, and most novices have given up in the first level. This has a lot to do with misunderstanding in what to do in the levels. The creators actually made sure that the game can be beaten by incorporating a lot of 1-Ups which were big helps. Some people have complained that the controls were the reasons why the game sucked. Honestly, they were just perfectly fine to me. It is a matter of jumping control: soft tap, medium tap, and hard tap. I can't stress this enough: Mastering the movement of Bart is the key of winning this game. The graphics were excellent for its time, and it's very good. To much of many's dismay, the best part of the game was actually the challenge itself. Thus, that's why The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants is a very well-made game and deserves a lot of credit for being a great Nintendo game made. This game has gotten my everlasting respect. For anyone else who hasn't beaten the game, you have to keep trying and trying. It takes heaps of practice. It takes days of practice. Use the genie at first to master parts of the game. When you have beaten it, then beat the game without one. And anyone else who have beaten it without the genie, you got my respect, and I know how much of work went into this in terms of trying to beat the game.

I'm trying to get all the games back I rememeber as a kid and the Simpsons games were some of my favorites. I have Bart VS. World, Bartman Meets Radioactive Man, and of course this one. Bart VS. the Space Mutants is by far the hardest of the three. I actually had this game on Sega as a kid, and remember it being harder for Sega than NES. The reason being is I played this without a Walkthrough I got online. Without a walkthrough this game is almost impossible.  I remember taking forever to figure out how to beat the first level, then when I finnally did I would die right away in the second level. What makes this game tough is it's not always clear where to go or what to do. A good example is on the 4th level there's two invisible platforms you have to jump on to beat the dinosaur. It can be frustrating to try to find something you can't see. However, don't let that deter you from this game. Like most NES games it's all about figuring out patterns and timing. With a Walkthrough or game FAQ this becomes a playable game. It's tough but there's only 5 levels all together. What makes it challenging is there's no continues in the game and two hits on Bart will cost you a life. You have to navigate the levels inch by inch and if you die you have to go back and play the previous levels to get back where you left off. With only 5 levels you would think it's a short game but again, it's challenging so beating a level takes a while. Once you beat a level though it becomes easier the next time around. For instance, I can blow by the first 3 levels but keep dying at the end of the 4th. The 5th level is the nuclear power plant which is a long level of figuring out combinations to beat the game. I've never been to that level but am close after a week of playing the game again after all these years. I would suggest either of the other two Simpsons games before this one. (Especially Bart Vs. World) However, if you love the Simpsons games definitely add this one to your collection.

Contra for the NES was a great port that extended the game and Super C is no different. Konami hit it out of the park again with the game as it was released on the NES in 1990. Super C came out with guns blazing and Contra fans responded.Super C (shortened from Super Contra) continued not too long ago from Contra and the aliens returned to Earth with a vengeance. They took over the military so it's up to you to run through eight stages, shooting possessed army soldiers, aliens and boss creatures. Choose from the same two guys from the first game. The weapons from the first game return but now with some changes: the flame weapon was able to be shot out into fireballs that spread out when it hit enemies and the ground, the laser weapon was shorter but thicker and the spread weapon had bigger bullets. You get three lives; lose them all and you can use three continues. Once you were out of continues, the game was over. Another player was able to join in at any time.The PROS: Just like Contra, Super C was an extended version of the arcade port. The arcade game had 5 stages; the NES added 3 stages for a total of 8 stages. Konami did a nice job with handling the graphics, sound effects and overall presentation as it looked great. The music in Super C was just as good as Contra and in some cases was more memorable. The controls were flawless and the 2 player co op returns doubling the amount of fun 2 players had back then. There was a different code to enter to get ten lives from the get go in case the game kicked your ass early on.The CONS: The only thing that was a knock on the game is that it is not as intense as Contra. Many players were able to beat Super C quickly compared to the previous game. I, myself, beat the game in four days and I have yet to beat Contra without using the thirty man code.Super C was more accessible than Contra in that it wasn't as hard and as a sequel, fans looked forward to playing it. It did not disappoint and would only convince Konami to keep making them. It's hard to get a brand new copy of the game so you can get it used, buy Contra 4 for the Nintendo DS as both NES games are unlock-able extras or you can download Super C from the Virtual Console service for the Wii for 800 points (US $8.00.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The sequel to Contra", "unixReviewTime": 1318291200, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2011"}

Rhodes", "helpful": [8, 9], "reviewText": "Then you need to pick up Super C, because of all the Contra games, I still find this to be the hardest of the lot.  However, Super C is a game where you can't wimp out.  Much like the first Contra, it takes practice to learn.  However, as far as advancing the series goes, Super C does it in the way a game ought to do it.  It keeps the same basic gameplay, but it throws in new enemies, harder levels and different level designs.  Simply put, mastering the first Contra doesn't give you an edge in Super C.There are eight levels in the game, and it works exactly as the first Contra did in this respect.  You will go through, running and gunning through tons of enemies.  You'll find many weapons for you to use.  They all come from the previous Contra game.  You'll find a machine gun, flame thrower (there are two types this time), laser and the Spread Gun.  Again, as any Contra veteran can tell you, the Spread Gun is perhaps the best weapon you could hope to get.  Strong, and can hit just about anything.What makes Super C much harder than the first Contra game is simply that there is more stuff that comes at you.  More enemies, and more gun shots to avoid.  Combine that with the fact that the Classic Konami code DOES NOT work with this game.  One hit, you're dead, and you've only got two lives to start with.  You earn more by scoring lots of points, but with bosses that are much more difficult in scope and enemies that take a lot more time to predict, Super C will have you dying of frustration (perhaps even literally).Super C does two player co-op exactly as the first one did it.  Again, there are few games that do two player co-op better than  the Contra series.  Super C is no exception.The music, while not better than the first Contra, is still fantastic.  Graphic wise it's also better than the first Contra.  It uses the same sprites but the environments are far more detailed.

Rather than reviewing the game itself, which has been done many times, I think many people may find the history how of this revolutionary title came to the videogame industry's rescue very interesting; I know I do. I draw much of this information from various websites, one very good one in particular; unfortunately, I can't really plug them due to Amazon's policies. Email me if you want the websites.By 1983, the gaming industry, in existence for a mere twelve years, had risen to an astonishing 3.2 billion dollar industry. Atari spearheaded the industry, which introduced its first console in 1977 (Atari Video Computer System), and since had grown to hold two thirds of the entire market. However, in 1984 all this would end with a thunderous crash. This concise overview will show you the history of the home consol crash and how SUPER MARIO BROTHERS came to the rescue.In 1976, Warner Communications bought Atari for $28 million from the company's founder, Nolan Bushnell. Over the next two years, Atari, suffering major production problems and Bushnell's bizarre management, lost Warner millions. Bushnell and Warner's CEO fought, and in 1978 Bushnell was forced to leave. Warner totally revamped the working style, and in 1979-1980, produced twelve new titles. However, Atari was still dragging down Warner's stock. Struggling to gain the market share, Atari made the smartest move they possible could have; in 1980, they began licensing arcade games, the first being SPACE INVADERS. Over the next two years, Atari overtook the market, bringing in over half of Warner's overall profits.However, very significant problems would totally destroy the infant industry. In 1981, Atari released PAC MAN on the VCS, and, because it was such a huge arcade hit, quickly became a bestseller. Unfortunately, the quality was very low. This was a major blow to the company's image, with fans and critics alike extremely disappointed.Another major stumble was one of video games' most infamous games, ET. Warner bought the rights from Spielberg for twenty one million dollars. Atari, expecting the game to be as big a hit as the movie, which was the highest grossing film at that point, purportedly made more ET cartridges than there were consoles themselves. ET proved to be a huge flop, nearly breaking Atari.By 1983, Atari was in serious trouble. Suing Activision (which was disgruntled Atari employees who broke off and formed their own company) and Imagic, the two leading third party developers, Atari tried to gain control over its software catalogue. Atari lost the suits. Third party developers began popping up overnight, and the industry becomes saturated with very low-quality products. (One of the most controversial is CUSTER'S REVENGE by Mystique, where the goal is to rape a Native American woman while avoiding being shot by arrows.) The third-party developers went bankrupt; these cartridges were heavily discounted, and the major companies couldn't compete. Another factor is the home computer market, that was just starting to come alive in 1984. With an increasing amount of computer games and low prices, people started buying these over the consoles.All these factors lead to the crash of 1984. In 1983 alone, Atari lost $356 million ($2 million daily). Warner sold Atari to Jack Tramiel, former head of Commodore. The video game industry died, with no major American corporation coming anywhere near it. Enter Nintendo.A little history here will be highly illuminating as well. What many people don't realise is Nintendo is a very old company, founded in 1889 (yes, you read that right) as a playing card company. It became Japan's largest playing card company, and was very successful. In the 1960s, they moved away from the cards and got into the game and toy markets. (A very interesting sidenote: during that same decade, Nintendo's president opened up a `special hotel' rented `by the hour.' Supposedly, the married president was one of the hotel's top customers). In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company scored significant points with big arcade hits and the Game and Watch product line. In 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom (Family Computer). It was a massive hit in Japan. In 1983, Nintendo went to Atari because they wanted to release the Famicon to the American market. Do to complications I won't go into, the deal fail through. In 1984 they were looking to broaden their market share.1985, Nintendo announced the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System. They release SUPER MARIO BROTHERS in Japan, scoring a huge hit. In 1986, the NES comes full throttle into the American market, quickly becoming the biggest selling console ever, largely because of this title. The NES owes much of its success to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS. Coming prepacked with the console, there are an estimated 40 million copies of SMB in existence, making it the highest selling video game ever.Unparalleled, SMB blew open the doors to the videogaming world. With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time. SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire. It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept. Also, it's one of the best. Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit.In the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment. With a powerful new console and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming. With its phenomenal success of the NES and this game, the video game industry once again took off, becoming one of the world's most significant economical contributors.And we very largely have this game to thank for it", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Biggest selling video game of all time (over 40 million copies); The game that singlehandedly saved the videogaming industry", "unixReviewTime": 1191456000, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2007"}

It's relatively new style of play (side-scrolling) in combination with an original story and the perfect difficulty arc (anyone can beat the beginning levels, but it takes a true pro to complete the game) made it the game that I played over and over again.  Whether it was screaming in frustration due to the Hammer Brothers, hearing in disbelief that the Princess \"was in another castle\", or the sheer joy of beating that next castle, I played the game over and over again.  Of course, being such a young child, I was never quite talented enough to complete the complicated jump moves or decipher the complex mazes (towards the end) well enough to actually beat the game.  Yet, I still had a heck of a time trying!Flash forward (LOST-style) 10-12 years later: Having been introduced to the NES at such a young age, I continued by brand loyalty to Nintendo by playing the Super Nintendo, Nintendo '64, Gamecube, and Wii.  I had a lot of good times with those machines, but one day I got the urge to fire up the old NES again, for old times sake.  Within moments (well, not exactly moments, as it took some blowing on the connectors and jiggling the game up and down) I was instantly transformed back into that excited six year old kid who couldn't wait to come home from school and play Mario.  This time around, with a little practice, I was able to conquer even the final Bowser.While playing the game at that older age, though, I was amazed at the purity of it.  It was original (which can't be said about most SNES games), it was straight-forward (not like Donkey Kong '64, for example), it's difficulty arc progresses in a logical fashion (not like GCN, where in many games you have to be a master gamer to step right in), and the game's internal bugs are cute and looked forward too, not annoying and troublesome as is sometimes the case on the Wii.Thus, taking all those things into consideration, Super Mario Brothers for the NES is, at least in my opinion, perhaps the closest thing to a \"perfect video game\" as has ever been created.  Not only did it practically save the entire gaming industry, but it also gave hours of entertainment to people across the world.  To me, only The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (for the '64) can challenge Mario Bros. in terms of overall game quality.So, if you are a nostalgic video gamer (like myself) who is a bit frazzled by the current obsessions and skill levels, I would highly recommend dusting of the old NES box and popping in Super Mario Brothers (it often comes on the same cartridge as Duck Hunt).

For the good, it's creatively made and goes into a new, different direction in terms of taking out the enemies, maintaining the life of the protagonist, and trying to win 1-Ups through slot machine playing. Everybody knows that points are futile in NES games, and it's rightfully gone in Super Mario Bros. 2. Also, there is no timer in the game, and there is back-and-forth ability that the original couldn't give. The challenge of the game isn't that too hard, so pretty much anyone can beat it with practice. One recommendation is that play with a game genie to beat the game first before doing it without it because the final boss, which occurs in world 7-2, is pretty difficult to beat. After getting the hang of it and knowing what to do, the game becomes progressively easier to beat. So, all left to do is to master the slot machines for easy 1-Ups. Lastly, the controls of Super Mario Bros. 2 are throughout excellent. For the bad, I found the game boring at times because it got repetitive in certain aspects. Why keep going against Birdo so many times? Can't the makers come up with a different villain each time? For many, which becomes a big problem, it's very hard to know where the mushroom might be unless you have a walkthrough map (provided by Snesmaster1) of each level. You really need a meter of 4 health points in each level you are in, and you can get hit this much and still win in each level anyway. Probably the worst single aspect of Super Mario Bros. 2 is the weird herky jerky motion that occurs at times. I've lost a plenty of lives due to that; it's like I am in a motion, and then somewhat, the screen freezes and moves on a slow snail death pace, causing me to lose momentum of what I am doing. If not for that, the game is more enjoyable to play. But this one did annoy me a lot at times. Finally, after beating the game, the ending is quite boring to watch. All in all, Super Mario Bros. 2 gets a 4 out of 5 from me because it's nowhere near the classic status of the original and is not even that memorable. Just a good game, but nothing more than that.

This is the only Mario game that you can pick every main character that alone is worth the price. Picking the veggies out the ground was cool, flyin carpets and the whole nine. Going in jars instead of pipes, actually having a live meter so you don't shrink when you get hit. Having different back drops and enimies was a nice twist. We haven't seen Wart since. Maybe Mario should take another nap. I've seen the Doki Doki game and yeah they ripped it off. But would you have wanted the original Mario 2 which is SMB 1 but harder.

The world is nothing like the world of the other Mario games, and the enemies and bosses and goal is different.  This is a quest to defeat Boss Wart (instead of Bowser) and you have the options of playing as one of four characters (with the ability to switch every level): Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad.  Each of these characters have different play characteristics.  Toad can pick up any object with no difficulty but is the worst jumper.  Princess is the opposite (no strength, but can float).  Luigi has the best jump (no float), but that becomes its own problem.  Mario is perfectly average.  These strengths and weaknesses come into play in choosing who to use for each level and some are clearly better than others on any given level. Even though I found this game to be the easiest of the bunch, for me it was also the most fun.  This is still a side-scrolling game, but some levels scroll up and down on the screen (keeping the side-scrolling viewpoint, though) depending on if you are climbing or dropping down.  There are shortcuts in many levels and different ways to warp, get extra lives (including an odd cheat for extra lives), or to shorten the game.  In the end, there are a couple of difficult levels, but this may be the easiest of the three on the NES.

But did you know that this game wasn't originally intended to be a Mario game? In fact in 1986 in Japan the TRUE Mario sequel was more like the original classic but a bit more difficult, so Nintendo of Japan did a Mario enhanced version of a game called \"Doki Doki Panic\" where it had nothing to do with the Mario Brothers but added the characters from the game into our version of Super Mario Brothers 2.But it's still a fantastic and fresh game experience! The story goes that your actually in a dreamworld called Subcon where Mario, Luigi, Toad and Princess Peace (a.k.a. Toadstool) where they must travel to different places of the dream world to fight against spy-guys, the flamboyant Birdo who spits eggs, killer Catcuses etc. and try to battle the evil King Wart who has imprisoned some of the dreamworld's citizens.In this game you get to chose out of 4 characters to play such as Mario, Luigi who is the best character with the best jumps, Princess Peace who can float and Toad who is strong but has weak jumps. This game is very different than the first one as instead of squashing enemies you can stand on them and pick them up so you can hurl at other enemies.

Basically the same game but with different levels, Mario and Luigi having different traits, and it was much harder (in America this game is commonly known as the &quot;lost levels&quot; found on Super Mario All Stars on the SNES). Nintendo of America wisely decided this wouldn't fly in America, it was just too similiar to the original. So instead they took another Japanese game, Doki Doki Panic, threw Mario and the gang into it and called it Super Mario Bros 2.Thank you Nintendo, because Doki Doki Panic/SMB2 is a great game! One of the best platformers ever. The game revolves entirely around the idea you can pick things up, either pulling vegetables out of the ground, enemies, or various other objects. This is all put to good use throughout the game providing interesting obstacles and tasks to complete. Things like having to throw the eggs back at the bird that just launched at you, having to lift creatures off their flying carpets so you can go for a ride, lift keys protected by magic masks, etc etc. Not to mention one of the best final boss encounters on the NES.

Nintendo has officially revealed that \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" began life as a prototype sequel to the original \"Super Mario Bros.\", even before \"The Lost Levels\", and was the intended second game in the series from the start.  Apparently Nintendo were having issues with the prototype (as they were trying to implement co-op game play, a series mechanic that would not see fruition until \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" from 2009, and developed \"The Lost Levels\" and published that on the Famicom Disk System in the mean time.  Fuiji Television approached Nintendo to develop a product for their 1987 Dream Event, so Nintendo took the existing Mario 2 sequel and released it in conjunction with Fuiji's promo event.(Also be sure to check out the Nintendo Power two part guide given away for free back in the late 1980s for NP subscribersSuper Mario Brothers 2 Inside Out [Nintendo Power])However, the important part is that not only was \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" a Mario game right from the start, Miyamoto and his team began developing the game BEFORE \"The Lost Levels\" as the intended sequel to \"Super Mario Bros.\"!  So for all you out there who say \"Super Mario 2\" isn't even a real Mario game, you have been proven wrong.  Not only that, Miyamoto himsmelf said in E3 2012 that, along with \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" is his favorite game in the entire Mario series.  Can't get much higher praise than that!  Mike London 10-1-2012]When \"Super Mario Brothers 2\" was released in the US in 1988, the game became an instant hit with gamers.  What makes SMB2 so strange is how utterly and drastically different the game really is from its predecessor,Super Mario Bros., which is one of the pivotal cornerstones of the gaming industry.  The game is expertly crafted (little surprise in that regard given it is a Miyamoto title), and just a great platformer with Mario quality, if not exactly Mario gameplay, written all over it..Like most Nintendo franchises that began in the 1980s, the second installment in the series was incredibly weird and very different from the original.  Case in point.Castlevania II: Simon's Quest.Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.  \"Super Mario Brothers 2\".Mega Man 2.  (Okay, I'm kidding about Mega Man 2.  Mega Man is the one series that DOES NOT CHANGE AT ALL.  Capcom remadeMega Manfive times, and then moved it to the X series and remade that a bunch more times).Instead of jumping on turtles and goombas, trying to reach high scores, timed levels, SUPER MARIO 2 had absolutely nothing to do with the original game.  It's like Mario is on a bad acid trip.  There's transgendered, sexually confused birds shooting eggs (Birdo), mice that throw bombs and sport sunglasses, a weird, occultic, socially inept brotherhood that wears masks and robes, demonic phantos guarding keys, and a giant lizard who styles himself as a king takes control of people's dreams (Freddy Krueger anyone?).  Given the previous game, \"Super Mario 2\" is easily the weirdest of the main Mario series, make no mistake.  The gameplay from SMB2, other than platforming, has absolutely nothing in common with the original SMB.  You throw enemies at one another, throw vegetables, fight weird enemies, blow up walls with bombs, etc.Although the Americans didn't know it at the time, Nintendo wasn't really releasing  SMB2.  By now this game's origins in well known, but back in the 1980s most gamers would have been shocked to realise that Nintendo took a preexisting game called DOKI DOKI PANIC, replaced the vaguely Arabian characters (one who was visibly pregnant) with Mario sprites, changed a few other sprites, rework the ending some, but otherwise leaving the game mechanics and the levels alone.Nintendo had already released a SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2 in Japan, but that game was much like the second quest of Zelda, a much harder version of what is ultimately the same game.  When it came time to release a SMB2 in America, the upper management bulked because of the Japanese title's extreme difficulty and remarkable similarity to the first SMB.  Howard Lincoln, at the time in charge of the North America division of Nintendo (and for you oldschool Nintendo Power readers, he's one half of the title characters comic strip \"Howard and Nestor\") also hated the Japanese SUPER MARIO 2.  So they opted to release another game in its stead.Enter YUME Kojo: DOKI DOKI PANIC (rough translation: \"Dream Factory: Heart Pounding Panic\").  Developed in cooperation with Fuji Television in promotion of Dream Factory '87, an event promoting Fuji's new television shows and other projects, DOKI DOKI PANIC, the game features a family of four characters who had to rescue these two lost children. In the game's intro, two children are reading from a book, when a giant hand grabs the children's faces and drags them into the book.  The children's pet monkey, Chim Chim, runs and grabs the Arabian family, who also just happened to be the mascots of the Dream Factory '87 promotional event. Convenient, that.  The family was Imagin (the son, replaced by Mario), Lina (Imajin's little sister, replaced by Princess Toadstool), Mama (who is clearly pregnant, with one of her hands clearly protecting her belly during gameplay; she was replaced by Luigi), and Papa (replaced by Toad).  The family enters into the world of Subcon to beat Wart (Mamu, as he is known in Japan, as well as the 1993 gameboy Zelda title LINK'S AWAKENING, his only other appearance in a Nintendo game).  Other than the family, all game characters were developed by Nintendo.Now, what are the differences?  I won't list them all here (google Doki Doki Panic and you'll find plenty of sites detailing the differences between SMB2 and Doki).  Actually, other than some graphical changes, none of the changes really effects gameplay with two major exception.  All four main characters are identical to their Doki counterparts.  The B-button super speed run was added to SMB2.  Nintendo replaced the storyline of having two kids kidnapped to Wart capturing Subcon people and Mario having to free them.  Still, the replacement storyline fits in with the original dreamworld association that was associated with Doki Doki (which, after all, means Dream Factory).The first of the two major differences between Doki Doki is that to see the end of the game, you must beat it with all four characters.  The four characters have savable progress, and when you clear the game with all four then the ending displays.  The second major difference is the replacement of Mouser in World 5-3 (his third appearance as the world end boss) with Clawgrip, a character exclusive too SMB2.What does this all have to do with our perception of SMB2 today?  As SMB2's origins have become common knowledge to video game enthusiasts and Nintendo fans (I found out in the late 1990s), a lot of people have put down this game due to it not being a Mario game to begin with.  But back in the 1980s and 1990s, before DOKI DOKI became well known, the general critical consensus was SMB2, though a vast departure from the original, was a very fun, well-executed game on its own right.  The game is among the highest selling Nintendo games of all time, with only SMB and SMB3 outselling the title on the original NES.  When they reissued SMB2 in 2001 as SUPER MARIO ADVANCE, the title sold very well also, and is the highest selling title in the ADVANCED series.There is another factor to consider.  Despite what the purists say, Shigeru Miyamoto was heavily involved in the development of this game, and actually had nothing to do with the Japanese SMB2.  As DOKI DOKI was to be a one-off promotional item for Fuji's Dream Factory, there has been some well-founded speculation Nintendo was planning this to be a Mario title the whole time and wanted to test the game by releasing it in Japan first.  The packaging on DOKI has a picture of Mario and Imagin together.While it is true SMB3, this game's sequel, reneged on most of SMB2 game mechanics, opting to return to the original SMB for its primary inspiration, most of SMB2's enemy characters became permanent cast members in the Mario echelon.Overall, though not originally released as a Mario title, for all gamers outside of Japan, this is what we think of as SMB2.  Playing thru the LOST LEVELS, which we finally got on the Virtual Console on October 1, 2007 (21 years after the fact), I'm glad Nintendo did what it did.  And since Nintendo did release a separate SMB2, we know have four NES Mario titles.  Mea culpa.  Fortunate accident.For my money, SMB2 is one of my all time favorite games.  I have distinct memories of trying to get SMB2 for the NES but couldn't because it was selling out so fast.  This was the big game of Christmas 1988, and you were a lucky kid indeed that had this game under their Christmas treeFor me, it is the one game, even more than SMB, that brings back the sweet incense of childhood and long bygone days I often times wish I could return too.  I have played and beaten the game countless times, but every time I go thru it I just feel transported back to my childhood.And for that mere fact, SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2 is a truly priceless game.--------------Bonus Content: I have decided to include bonus content for this review.  The first section  is additional information I have assembled for the game that is separate from the review proper.  The second is an unreleased article about \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" and its relation with \"The Lost Levels\" written back in the late 1990s.Section 1:  It has become well known that \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" was not originally a Mario game. According to many sources, what Nintendo employee blocked the release of Japanese version of \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" (known outside Japan as \"The Lost Levels\") due to the high challenge and gimmick-filled gameplay. This decision led to Nintendo adapting \"Doki Doki Panic\" into a Mario game.  Howard Lincoln, president of the North American Branch of Nintendo, made that decision.\"Super Mario Bros. 2\" has long been one of my favorite NES titles from childhood. It is well known now (though not back in the 1980s and early 1990s) that \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" began life originally as a game called \"Doki Doki Panic\" for the Famicom Disk System. The Japanese FDS version of \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" is pretty much a clone of the original, only with slightly modified graphics and a much more difficult game.Nintendo would not publish the original Famicom Disk System outside of Japan for over twenty one years. The game first appeared in 1986 in Japan, and America and the PAL region did not get the original 8-Bit version until 2007 for the Virtual Console.Another famous Howard in Nintendo lore is Howard Phillips who appears in the early issues of \"Nintendo Power\" in the comic strip \"Howard and Nestor\". There is also a photograph of Phillips next to a TV that has the main title screen of the (American-European) \"Super Mario Bros. 2\".Published in 1987 for the Famicom Disk System, Nintendo published \"Doki Doki Panic\" for Fuji Television. The game was to promote Yume Kj '87 (translates Dream Factory '87), and included Fuji's mascots. Overall, the levels from Doki Doki Panic were left alone. The majority of the changes were swapping out sprites and cosmetic changes.When Nintendo released \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" in Japan as a Mario game rather than the non Mario \"Yume K'j': Doki Doki Panic\", they marketed the game as the American \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" and released the game as \"Super Mario Bros. USA\". The only difference between the American version and this version is a different title screen.There is a slight level change in one level. In 7-2, in the cloud section there is a portion of the stage where you must go back and forth on stationary cloud platforms that are stacked on top of one another in order to get to a ladder that has a column blocking access. In \"Doki Doki Panic\", there is an additional cloud platform, with a small column with a Snifit sitting on top. The most probable reason Nintendo removed this platform was even with the Mario and Toad character a super jump could completely bypass the cloud section and the player could simply jump over the column to get to the blocked off ladder.The original characters are a family, with two parents with one son and one daughter. Mario replaced Imajin, the average skilled brother. Luigi replaced Mama. The Princess replaced Lina, the sister. Toad replaced Papa. There is speculation that Mama appears to be pregnant.When Nintendo adapted \"Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic\" into \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", they replaced the third Mouser with a new boss character, Clawgrip. Mouser appears the same as World 1-3, though his chamber is shaped differently and there are two sections with spikes on the floor.I remember my parents buying this game for me and being puzzled why Phanto looked different in the manual than he actually appears in the game. The reason is Nintendo published the \"Doki Doki Panic\" sprite in the manual, rather than the sprite that actually appears in the game. Phanto in \"Doki Doki Panic\" has small eyes and he is frowning. He does not look nearly as menacing as he does in \"Super Mario Bros. 2\". The game manual also includes pictures of the Magic Jar and the Heart sprite from \"Doki Doki Panic\".According to the manual, Clawgrip \"grows suddenly and is surprisingly skilled at throwing rocks\". It is possible this refers to some gameplay concept of Clawgrip that never got into the final game, as Clawgrip does not change sizes in the actual game.There were numerous errors in the Cast of Characters section of \"Super Mario Bros. 2\". Ostro, an ostrich that Shyguys ride, are given the name Birdo, and Birdo is labeled Ostro. Personally I believe this was a localization error, as the error was repeated in the game manual itself. Strangely enough, when Nintendo released \"Super Mario Allstars\" for the Super Nintendo, they did not correct this error, though they did correct it in the \"Super Mario Advance\" release. I remember back in the late 1980s all us gamers thought Birdo had two names, Birdo and Ostro, as Nintendo Power referred to Birdo as Birdo, not Ostro.The Albatros, the only flying bird in \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", appears to be Subcon's natural resident before the Wart invaded.Here is the game manual entry related to the Albatros. \"He used to be the only resident in the world of dreams. Now, by order of Wart, he works as a carrier of Bob-Ombs.\"In \"Doki Doki Panic\" he only has two frames of animation, making him appear to fly much faster. For the \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" conversion Nintendo added three more frames of animation, bring the total to five.-----Section 2: Super Mario Brothers 2: The Next Adventure (written in the later part of 1999).SMB2 is held as a classic in most video gaming circles.  And yet, it depends on what you are talking about, and, precisely, where you are doing the talking.  If you are in Japan, you are talking about a game that plays almost identical to the original, but much, much, more difficult.  If you are in the States, you are talking about a Japaness game that originally had nothing to do with the SMB saga.If I had to pick, I'd pick the States version any day.  In this game, you get to choose from four different characters, and make your way thru 7 worlds.  Very fun, although not incredibly challenging.  I grew up playing this game (Lugi is still the best).  We bought it when it first came out, and boy did it take forever to get it.  That game literally sold like hot cakes.  It was one of the most anticipated games that year, along side the ranks of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.  However, public reaction to this game was very favourable, whereas to Zelda II it was not.  It was totally different from its prequel, and, honestly, that's what made that game so great.  Because of its differences from the rest of the Mario cannon, it stands alone.  I remember my brother, his best friend Nick, and I (and another boy Rammy) took turns playing it, and we watched as he tried to get past that wiley Wart.  In the end, of course, Mario triumphed, and it turned into nothing save a dream ....  (Is that the story line of some Zelda game?)  Anyway, it is still a classic game.In Japan, however, SMB 2 is totally different.  Imagine this: Super Mario Brothers, after beating the original game, a Second Quest, much like one of the more popular titles also had.  And this Second Quest, just like Nintendo's corresponding cash cow, was increased in difficulty.  Now we have SMB 2.  Basically, SMB 2 plays just like SMB 1.  Actually, I tend to think of these worlds as worlds 9-18.  Basically, they correspond in that difficulty.  If you think level 7 or 8 was hard on the original, just imagine what world 17 or 18 is!!  It truly is that difficult.Indeed, it was so difficult that it was damned to stay unreleased forever in the States on the original NES.  Also, they didn't htink the market could support it.  However, I have beat this game, and I can easily say that is the most difficult game I've ever beaten.  The whole thing is a total nightmare.  The difficulty level is totally absurd.  Its like Miyamoto and his team got together, and said \"Let's make a sequel to SMB, and its make it so frustratingly hard that the players will destroy their Famicoms in sheer rage.\"  It is truly that difficult.  Yet, if you do actually beat the game, you can stand in pride.  On Super Mario Allstars, five new worlds were added. If you went thru the first eight without warping, Level Nine opened up (which is totally an anomoly.  All water stages, save for the third).  Then, after that, worlds A-D can be transversed.  As I understand it (I didn't know this until just last night), these worlds were added to the Super NES version.  I beat them too.We have finally got as close to the original version as we'll ever see.  They released it with Super Mario Brothers Deluxe, and called it Super Mario Brothers for Super Players (you just have to get over 300,000 points.  I thought you had to get that and beat the game, so I was trying to do that, and didn't realize it was already opened).  I'd be really interested in buying a Japaness cart and play it on the Famicom.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Sweet Incense of Childhood!", "unixReviewTime": 1191456000, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2007"}

I had the first and third mario games for the nes so i wanted to complete the trilogy and buy the seconed one. I played like a 1 miniute demo of the game but it was not long enough. so when i bought it and it came to me, it came to me that this is not the same mario. The only  part i like about it is there is a choice of 4 cherecters each of their own special moves. Mario is just regular but he looks almost completly different. Luigi looks different too but it is really annoying with his cherecter that he slides everywhere when he walks or runs. Peach is not being rescued on this game she is my favorite charecter because so floats for a short period of time and she controls well. Toad on the otherhand can jump very high and go fast. Each charecter can duck and when it glows u can do a super jump. They also can pick up items in the ground like onions and plants and throw it at the enemy. THAT IS ALSO THE ONLY WAY U CAN DEFEAT THEM TOO. There is no jumping on them anymore. To defeat the bosses u jump on their eggs they spit out at u and u pick them up and throw it at them. IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS IS THE JAPANESE FAMICON VERSION (DOKI DOKI PANIC),NOT MARIO. They just changed the charecters to mario.What did nintindo think when they did this? This game is also hard to beat, i could not even get to world 3. If there is even that many. ITS NOT EVEN 2 PLAYER!!! The only reason i still have it is because its part of the trigoly and it will be worth more when u sell all of them together.

And that word is: Odd.As the second game in the series, Mario Bros. 2 does exactly everything that you WOULDN'T expect from a sequel to the first game. It takes the characters in the Mario universe, adds them to a strange and quirky world, and then takes the gameplay of the first game and absolutely tips it on it's head.There are several design changes that factor in to making Super Mario Bros. 2 so different from the first game in the way it plays. First off is the elimination of the timer. Since there is no timer on any of the levels, you are no longer racing to try and finish the game as fast as you can. The second difference is the fact that you can go backwards in a level. In the original game, when the level scrolled, you could no longer go back in that direction (which made sense in Mario 1 because you are always racing to reach the end of the level before the timer runs out and you die, so there is no reason to go back).Thirdly . . . while Super Mario Bros. 1 popularized the aspect of a side-scrolling game, meaning that the screen scrolls to reveal a bigger playfield (instead of being confined to a single-screen as in games like Pac-Man or Galaga) it was still a game that was confined in the sense that you could only go forwards, you were forced to go forwards (even though you scrolled the screen yourself). Super Mario Bros. 2 changed all that by letting the scrolling of the level, either forwards or backwards, be completely up to the player.However the biggest change did not come from the aforementioned improvements, but rather from another improvement . . . one that you didn't really see much of in the first Super Mario Bros. This sequel let the player explore the world in a whole new way . . . a new dimension. And that dimension was vertically. Mario 2 opens up the whole notion of vertical gameplay to the player. Whether it's jumping onto platform after platform that are suspended in the air, or climbing vines or ladders, Super Mario Bros. 2 sends the player vertically just as often as you scroll left or right, which is a dramatic change.The combination of the lack of a timer, the ability to go backwards and the insistence of the levels in pushing you upwards, gives Super Mario Bros. 2 a COMPLETELY different feel as far as level design goes. And that vertical aspect comes into play as soon as you start the game and are immediately dropped from a door in the sky to the ground below you.Believe it or not, these are not the only changes that separate Super Mario Bros. 2 from it's prequel.But I'm getting ahead of myself here. First a look at some history. Although many do not know it, one reason that Super Mario Bros. 2 is so different from all the other games in the series is because it originally was not a Mario game at all! What we know in America as Super Mario Bros. 2 was actually a game that was only released in Japan. This game was developed by Nintendo and called Doki Doki Panic. Actually the full title is Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panikku which translates to Dream Factory: Doki Doki Panic.This quirky NES game was Mario-ized and brought to America and other regions as Super Mario Bros. 2. The Mario version was also later released in Japan as Super Mario USA.The real sequel to Super Mario Bros. was actually a game that was strikingly similar to the first game. Matter of fact it was really just a remixed version. It was much more difficult than the original and allowed you to play single-player as either Mario or Luigi, with both characters having different abilities (Luigi jumped higher but was harder to stop once he took off running). It also added the new Poisonous Mushroom (identified by their purple color) to the equation. If you grabbed a Poisonous Mushroom it'd harm you rather than help you.Nintendo of Japan however had a hard time deciding whether or not to release Super Mario Bros. 2 (Jap) in the US, fearing that it would be too difficult for American players (it was common in the Japanese video game world at that time to underestimate the abilities of American and European players, even though we had no problem with supremely tough games like Metroid or Contra).So they decided to take another game that they thought was easier (which is quite ironic, cause it's definitely not an easy game) and modify the game, making it into a Mario title to release in the US as Super Mario Bros. 2. The game was developed in cooperation with Fuji Television (who licensed the characters for Nintendo to use) to promote their Yume Kj '87 event in Japan, which showcased several of Fuji TV's latest TV shows and other products at the time. Doki Doki Panic featured the mascots of the Yume Kj festival (an Arabian family consisting of siblings Imajin and Lina and their parents, Papa and Mama) as its main characters and the rest of the characters, including the main villain, Mamu (Renamed Wart for the modified American version), were all original creations by Nintendo for the game.Doki Doki Panic takes place within a book with this Arabian or Indian setting (which explains the desert landscapes and Arabian-style sounding music) where all four characters are sucked into it's world. They are all playable as well, and the game is not completed until the player plays through the game as all four of them, unlike in the American remake.For the modified US version of Doki Doki Panic, Mario corresponds to the Imajin character, Princess Toadstool (or Peach as she's known now) corresponds to Lina, Luigi corresponds to Mama and the stout Papa corresponds to Toad.So Nintendo did all this modifying (leaving most of the game exactly the same, including the enemies and bosses and most of the music and sound effects) thinking that no American player would know the difference. And they were right. Unless you worked in the video game industry or for gaming publications and were in the know, then you'd never realize that what you were playing was not a \"true\" Mario game.Super Mario Bros. 2 (US) was widely accepted by the people that played it despite it's oddball flavor, and it become so popular and infamous for it's uniqueness that it actually became considered by Nintendo as the real Super Mario Bros. 2 and took it's place alongside the other core games in the Mario saga (Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, and 3, Super Mario World, Super Mario 64, etc.).And the elements of Super Mario Bros. 2 (US) that weren't originally Mario but Doki, such as the enemies like Bob-Ombs, Birdo and Shy Guy`s (who were unchanged from their Doki Doki Panic origins), actually became part of the Mario universe.Nowadays Birdo has developed more into a full-fledged Mario mascot character and taken his place alongside Yoshi; as is evidenced by her appearance as a Yoshi team-up character in Mario Kart: Double Dash on GameCube and in some Mario sports titles.Had Nintendo never converted Doki Doki Panic into a Mario game and released it as such in the US, then many of the beloved characters that people now love would never have existed. And that would definitely be a shame.So I for one am glad that we got this Nintendo game instead of the \"real\" Super Mario Bros. 2 [Jap] since it is much more unique and original than what we would have gotten, and the new enemies that came along for the ride ended up being great additions to the Mario family (The Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 btw would later hit America for the Super Nintendo as part of the Super Mario All-Stars compilation, in which it was included as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels)So . . . now getting back to the differences in gameplay between Super Mario Bros. 1 and this Super Mario Bros. 2 (US). Whereas the main form of attack in the original game is jumping on the heads of the various enemies, this game changed all that by allowing every enemy in the game (virtually) to be picked up and thrown. Matter of fact, there are no enemies in the game that can be destroyed by jumping on their heads! Your form of attack is now exclusively picking up and throwing. And it's not just enemies that you can pick up and throw at other enemies, but lots of other things as well. For example, the game is also littered with . . . . VEGETABLES! Veggies can be pulled out of the ground and hurled to kill enemies (All enemies in the game die with one hit outside of bosses) and you will find that they play a prominent role throughout the game. They appear in both small and large varieties.Super Mario Bros. 2 was also the first Mario game to introduce other playable characters, which was a huge change from the first game. In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as not only Mario and Luigi, but also the Princess and Toad. While both of the latter characters did appear in the first Super Mario Bros., it was really Super Mario Bros. 2 that popularized them and made legions of fans of those characters since it was our first shot at actually being able to play as them. And even though they were simply character swaps for the Doki characters, most people, like me, didn't know that as kids and took a personal liking to the Toad and Princess characters. I have always loved Toad ever since I played Super Mario Bros. 2 when I was about 5 years old. I thought the little guy was great (and I'm still holding out hope that he'll get his own spot as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl).Each character has their own abilities that make them useful in different situations. The speed at which they run or the height of their jump when holding an item, the speed at which they lift items, and the height of their jump all differs between characters.Mario (typical nowadays) is the \"average\" character, he doesn't really excel at any one ability. Luigi is the character with the highest jump, he's also the tallest character. Toad is the shortest of the bunch and also the quickest at running and lifting, but he also has the lowest jump. Princess on the other hand is the slowest lifter, but she has an ability that's completely unique to her character (and one she inherited for her debut in Super Smash Bros. Melee) . . . if you hold the jump button, she can FLOAT for a short time! This almost makes her a kind of unfair character as she really is a great choice no matter what level you are on cause you can almost always benefit from her floating ability.As for the other features of Mario, such as coins and items, everything in Super Mario Bros. 2 has been changed up or altered from the first game. Although the way you progress from level to level is still largely the same, as there are a number of worlds and each world has 3 levels, and it uses the same dash system, so world 2-2 would mean the second level on the second world. Pipes though, a major feature of the first Super Mario Bros. have been replaced with these objects that look like vases, some of which can be entered by pressing down, leading inside the vase, much like a pipe in the first game.You now have a life bar made up of hearts on the left side of the screen. If you lose all your hearts by getting hit, then the containers will empty and you will die. If you only have one heart then you are small. You start with two containers, and can get up to four in any one level (containers do not carry on to the next level).If you are small, then getting another heart or a Mushroom will make you grow. Mushrooms are the only way you can get another heart container, and you only find Mushrooms in what is known as \"sub-con\", which is basically another dimension of the world. Throughout the levels are a certain number of these red potions. You will pull them up from the ground like a vegetable. If you throw the potion, it will create a door. Enter that door and whatever is on the screen will turn dark to signify that you are in another dimension, in \"sub-con\".Sub-con is a big part of the game. Mushrooms, as well as coins, only appear in sub-con. But Mushrooms only appear in a specific spot. So to get that Mushroom, you are required to throw the door at the place where you think a Mushroom may be. While it's true that Mushrooms theoretically can appear anywhere in a level, they will generally appear in some obvious places, usually where you find many vegetables or something else to give you a hint. Vegetables in Sub-Con turn into coins (one veggie counts as one coin). Coins count towards how many tries you will have at the slot machine in between stages, where you can earn extra lives (and it is the only way to earn extra lives outside of some uncommon 1-Up Mushrooms that you will occasionally pull from the ground).The last big piece of the Super Mario Bros. 2 world are cherries. Cherries kind of take the place of coins in the previous Super Mario Bros., that is, while outside Sub-Con you will see cherries just floating in the air, as coins did in the previous game (actually, they aren't so much floating as nailed, literally, to the air). Grabbing enough cherries will summon a Starman, which works just as in Super Mario Bros. and will give you invincibility for a short amount of time.Super Mario Bros. 2 keeps a nice balance in the way the various game mechanics come into play. For example, unlike most games, the only way to heal yourself (outside a Mushroom) is by killing enemies, which will summon a heart to come floating onto the screen from below, collect it to fill a heart container. This helps in giving you a reason to actually kill enemies instead of simply running past them. You will also occasionally come across other items that you will pull from the ground. These include Shells, which you throw and jump on top of as they slide across the ground, killing any enemies in their path, Stop Watches, which you will pull from the ground once you've pulled 5 big vegetables. Stop Watches will freeze time for a short period. You will also occasionally come across \"POW\" blocks. These big black boxes will shake the screen once thrown and destroy any enemy that's touching the ground. POW's are still a really cool part of the Mario universe, although they haven't shown up as prominently since Super Mario Bros. 2. But they did make a cameo appearence in the first Super Smash Bros. on the Classic Mushroom Kingdom stage and they occasionally will pop-up in different Mario titles.The last real item you'll come across are bombs. Similar to in the Zelda series, you will come across bricks which can be blown up by using bombs. Bombs will explode a bit after you pick them up and you pull them from the ground like you would vegetables. Bombs will always appear near where they need to be used.And speaking of bombs, this segues into the almost puzzle like aspects of Super Mario Bros. 2. There are many points in the game where you will have to bomb walls or bricks in a certain way. For example, there may be a platform above a lower one, with breaks and walls that can be bombed, blocking the middle of the bottom platform. And if you go into sub-con a Mushroom will appear, but you may only be able to get that Mushroom if you have bombed the right spots.Early on you will come to a secret where you need to drop a bomb down a skinny area where a bombable wall is blocking the door. But it's only wide enough for your character and if you fall or climb down you don't have enough room to throw the bomb. So you gotta drop it from above, and the key is to wait for the bomb to flash and time your throw so that it blows up at the right time, destroying at least two blocks, which will give you enough room to fit in through the gap. And these types of little bombing areas are numerous.Unlike the original Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2 is a lot more non-linear. You can pretty much complete the levels as slow or as quick as you want, for the reasons mentioned above, but also the world itself is also a lot more complex.The world in Super Mario Bros. 2 is full of doors. All the doors can be entered and exited by pressing the Up Button. And there is almost no point where you can not re-enter a door, leaving the player free to explore the world pretty much at their leisure. Doors can lead to all kinds of places, and some levels will have over ten doors (or much less . . . or more), leading in and out of various areas. You will also find many places that are populated with vines, ladders (leading to higher or lower levels) and vases, some of which can be entered. Making the world of Super Mario Bros. 2 a lot larger with various areas and environments within one level. Which is a big improvement over the original game.Super Mario Bros. 2 has great variety in the design of it's levels. Some worlds are themed to a degree as well. You will come across desert landscapes, ice and snow levels, and more green, tropical style levels (complete with Palm Trees), which generally come with a lot of waterfalls. The first time you see a desert stage though, or even the initial level with it's waterfalls, you will realize how big of an improvement the game is graphically over the original Mario Bros.Stages have their own quirks too that make them different. Desert stages for example will have pyramids that you can enter. Once you're inside you will find that you will need to press the B Button to dig through the soft sand. Digging will have the character pull out that space of dirt right below them . . . . and there is lots of dirt! Generally you will have to dig about 5 or more screens before you reach the bottom, encountering enemies and cherries along the way. This mechanic still feels really cool and I can't even think of another game that's similar in the digging department.You will also encounter locked doors in Super Mario Bros. 2, and they will require a key that you will have to pick up and carry from one location (generally far away) to the location of the door that is locked. Picking up a key will summon these faces/masks called Phanto`s, that are on the wall and will chase after you. If you throw the key they will go away until you pick it up again, and they can't be killed.A lot of these locked doors will be found inside these kind of construction/warehouse type environments (though like the first game, much of Super Mario Bros. 2 is only black backgrounds), where you will find chains you can climb, Mushroom Blocks you can pick up, stack and throw, and various hazards ranging from Sparky enemies that will encircle platforms and harm you if you touch them, to spikes or even pits where you will die or be damaged if you fall.The non-linear nature of Super Mario Bros. 2 really comes into play throughout the game. You will come to find that lots of levels actually have multiple paths you can take. Or at least two paths. And many of them feature secrets that will lead to \"backdoors\", these doors will take you directly to the boss of the level, or to our pal Birdo.Birdo is a strange dinosaur-like creature who spits eggs out at you and serves as a boss, mini-boss and all around common enemy throughout the game. You will fight different varieties of Birdo in different environments. The main form of attack Birdo has is spitting out eggs, which you jump on top of and throw back at him (her? In the new games it's a girl) to kill it. You will also encounter Birdo's that spit fire. At the end of nearly every stage will be a Birdo fight. So learn to enjoy them!The end of the level, generally after a Birdo fight will lead you to a pearl that when picked up will open this \"Bird Door\" that will lead to the next level. The Bird Door only helps to give the game it's dreamy, otherwordly kind of feel.While Super Mario Bros. 2 is easily one of the best games from my childhood and thus it has a lot of nostalgic value, playing through it again has made me realize how many memorable moments the game has. And that I believe is it's biggest difference from the first Super Mario Bros. game. The stages are SOO unique. And there really are too many cool moments to name.One level for example has a giant waterfall. You start about half-way, and there are clouds leading upward, which is the direction to go if you want to proceed through the level. If, however, you jump down, you will fall and in the middle at the bottom of the waterfall is a little island (if you miss the island you fall to your doom). There is a door on the lil' isle, go inside and you will find a room packed full of veggies. And somewhere in there is a potion, if you can find it all those veggies (or as much as you can pull, if you haven't pulled them up before entering Sub-Con) will of course be coins. And you get the Mushroom as well.Another level has a huge uncrossable gap. The only way to cross it is to use Birdo! He'll shoot an egg and you can actually jump on top of that egg and it will sail you across to the other side. Don't forget to take the potion with you! Another waterfall level has you crossing the waterfalls by jumping on top of fish which will jump up from below. But you have to be careful because if you fall you'll die. Still another level has you sailing on top of a bird! With no ground beneath! Another stage features whales. These whales will shoot water out of their blow holes which you can stand on to get to the higher platforms.And that is just the tip of the iceberg! The levels in Super Mario Bros. 2 easily and single-handedly eclipse anything in the original Super Mario Bros. From the digging to the ice worlds to the secrets to the backdoors and multiple paths to the various environments to the warp pipes to the bosses, Super Mario Bros. 2 is one diverse game.And you really get better the more you play too. As in the example above of the room with a ton of vegetables demonstrates (you will encounter a lot of similar rooms), the player will benefit from actually knowing the layout of the stages and knowing where Mushrooms, Potions and whatnot are located.And did I mention the bosses? This game has some really cool boss fights. Such as Mouser, a mouse who will hurl bombs at you. You have to catch the bombs and toss or set them up on his platform, timing them right so that they explode and hit him as he gets close to them. Or Fry Guy, a big flame-head that will fly around the room dropping little fires. You have to use the Mushroom Blocks in the room to hit him three times (which is the sweet spot for most bosses) by using the platforms above where he flies, after which he'll burst into four little flames that must be extinguished before he is completely defeated.A cool element of the Fry Guy fight is the fact that, while the fight takes place on one-screen, you can keep going through the edge of the screen at which point you'll pop-out on the other side. In fact, if you go half-way, then half of you will be on one-side and the other half will be on the other side! You can even hurl a Mushroom Block at the edge of the screen and, naturally, watch it sail onto the other side, hopefully hitting Fry Guy in the process.This kind of effect is really neat and a far cry from anything you see in the first Super Mario Bros. And there are other levels where this effect will come into play as well. One stage in particular has you hopping on platforms to reach the top of the screen, where-in it will scroll up one, until you reach the top of the environment. But while on a single screen and hopping on the platforms leading up, there are platforms on the edges which you can stand on and if you keep going to the edge of the screen you'll pop-up on the platform on the opposite side. So while you are going up you'll encounter plants that will be coming down . .. this plant will shoot fire that will fall both on the left and right of the plant. The only way to avoid it is to run across the platforms at the edge to pop out on the other side of the screen if the fire is coming your way. It's hard to describe but in the actual game it happens seemlessly and is a cool gameplay effect.And it's this type of unique gameplay that makes the game really imaginative and fun. You really haven't seen anything like it, and even today it is unique among 2D 8-bit platformers. It's also interesting that you actually seem to do a lot more platforming and jumping in Super Mario Bros. 2 than you do in the original, which is ironic considering how the original is all about jumping. The world in Super Mario Bors. 2 is HUGE too compared to the original Super Mario Bros., and the game, if played straight through, is much longer, at least twice if not three times as long.Super Mario Bros. 2 also contains an incredible amount of secrets. You will find many pathways which will lead off the beaten path. Generally they will either take you to an area full of coins, or they will lead to a backdoor that will quickly take you past the level and directly to the boss. The first time you find one of these and you find yourself entering the boss stage by jumping down from the dirt roof at the top it will hit you that this is one unique game (the roof area is just a straight wall leading to the top of the screen and naturally there is no way to get up there from the other side).And secrets like the one mentioned above litter the levels. And many of these are really memorable moments that will probably stick with you after you have completed the game. And for those that have played Super Mario Bros. 2 before it will be really gratifying encountering these nostalgic scenes again. I know for me it brought many fond memories flooding back into my brain.I mean who doesn't remember throwing Mushroom Blocks on top of clouds so that you could stand on them and cross the gap? (even though Princess can simply float across). Or letting the quicksand in one level take you UNDER the starting wall . . . which leads to a backdoor to the boss? If you haven't encountered these secerts then you really owe it to yourself to experience it.The game even contains some well hidden warp pipes (er . . . warp vases?), which will transport you to another world. The warp pipes are cool to find as they can only be found/discovered in Sub-Con, and you will only know it's a warp pipe by entering it. Can you find them all?The game is also surprisingly difficult. Yet it's rarely frustrating, which is a nice balance. It can be easy to die and you will die quite a bit, but you will always feel that it was your own mistake that killed you, not anything cheap. And due to the slot machine in between levels and how many coins you find, you will generally have lots of extra lives, so getting \"Game Over\" is pretty hard to do unless you are super reckless.Graphic-wise, the game is really colorful in comparison to Super Mario Bros. 1, which has a really dull color pallet, although the NES version of Super Mario Bros. 2 isn't nearly as colorful as the All-Stars version, which also has characters that are much, much improved. And obviously the environments are a lot more diverse, with desert landscapes, ice, waterfalls, frozen places, and more. It really gives the game a lot of variety and you will never get bored with the levels.All the tunes in the game are good and if you played the game back in the day then they will definitely bring back some extremely nostalgic memories and feelings. The music is nice, happy and upbeat, except for the inside/warehouse type tune, which is perfectly fitting. While the music is pretty great overall, there really are only a few tunes which play throughout the whole game which can get old.Super Mario Bros. 2 actually has quite a lot of replay value. I played the game start to finish three times for this review. The first time I used warp pipes (skipping some worlds entirely), the second time I followed secrets and back doors (skipping large parts of some levels) and the third time I played straight through without using any secrets or back doors. So the game contains a lot of replay value for a game of it's age.All in all, Super Mario Bros. 2 is a phenomenal platformer by anyone's standards. It holds up to the test of time extremely well and is no less fun nowadays. And if you've never played the game before then you surely are in for a great time. There are tons of secrets to discover and it's very likely that you will play the game several times if you want to see the entire game. The gameplay is so unique that I can't even think of a modern game (or classic one for that matter), that comes close to mimicking what is on display in Super Mario Bros. 2. And even if it did, Super Mario Bros. 2 definitely does it best. The gameplay is so refined that it's practically perfect. Any complaints I have are so minimal they aren't even worth mentioning.Super Mario Bros. 2 is a definite classic that all gamers should have in their library.Should I buy Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Wii?As the most unique and different Mario game in the series, there is no reason why you shouldn't purchase this $5 NES title on the Wii. Whether you have played it before or not, it's probably still worth purchasing due to the sheer amount of replay value it has for an 8-bit pre Super Mario Bros. 3 title.Even if you have played it extensively, it's still a fun game and there is surely some parts of the game you haven't seen. So why not add it to your collection? And the Wii will make it much easier to get the game for those that don't want to play it on a portable system and don't feel like tracking it down for one of their older consoles (SNES and NES) and having to deal with cartridge problems.FUN FACTOR: 8.0With it's pick-up-and-throw gameplay, bevy of secrets and really unique worlds, the gameplay stays fun throughout the 7 worlds of the game, with lots to see; requiring a few play-throughs before you will see it all.Graphics: 8.5The game looks great . . . for an NES title. While it is very colorful compared to Super Mario Bros., it still looks dull today, especially the characters, and especially in comparison to the SNES All-Stars version. The unique environments make up for the graphical detail though.Ingenuity: 9.0This is by far, with the exception of perhaps Yoshi's Island, the most unique game in the 2D Super Mario Bros. series. No other game involves picking up and throwing things in the way Mario 2 does, and while it's not mind-blowing nowdays, it was for the time. And even now it still feels highly original and the gameplay is refined to near perfection. The idea of Sub-Con is also really neat and was highly original for the time as well.Replay Value: 8.5Due to multiple paths, lots of secrets, hidden warp pipes and back doors, Super Mario Bros. 2 is not a game where you can see everything your first play-through. It will take a few play-throughs to see all that it has to offer, and the game stays pretty fun throughout even though you are simply hurtling things beginning to end. Most people who want to see all the games has to offer will want to play more than once, which is pretty good for this type of game since there are no difficulties, no extra modes and no 2-player.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An all time classic!", "unixReviewTime": 1301702400, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2011"}

This is the only few games from the console that can get away with stepping out of the box to create a whole new different game, succeed at it, and make a second sequel by going back to the original format with some added features (Super Mario 3)!  For 1988, the graphics were top notch and the game play was appropriate for all ages.  Instead of a two player game with just Mario and Luigi, the game is a one player game of which you get the choice of two other characters, Toad and Princess Toadstool.  Each of them have their own special strengths and weaknesses when it comes to speed, jumping, and picking up items and small enemies (no stomping on this Mario game).  Luigi is the best jumper, Toad has the best strength and speed, Mario is second best at everything, and Princess Toadstool can float.  For the first time, a life bar is used instead of a automatic \"one hit, you grow small\"  You do grow small, but you get two more chances (depending on how many mushrooms you collect in the sub-level).  Once life bar can be replenished by collecting a floating heart (it comes after you defeat a certain amount of enemies in one screen).  The POW box returns (of which knocks all enemies from the screen) since the 1983 Mario Bros game.  Although this game is a hack from the Japanese NES game, Dookie Dookie Panic, it stands the test of time for all gamers and has been remastered and re-released a few times and its enemies (such as Shy Guys, Sniffets, Birdo, and Bo-bombs) returned in many future Mario games within the next 21 years along with the Original Mario enemies.

SMB had taken America by storm and changed the way NES was packaged and sold. People - *old* people of 30 years or more would get the thing out at parties and challenges would start, to the point that some wives would hide the cords when hosting guests.SMB2, however, was a damp squib. The game play was so radically different to SMB's run-jump-and-squish that people were not happy with it. Hell, I sat with one guy and we couldn't figure out what we were supposed to do from the start screen. After a few minutes we just played something else.I recently scored a copy of this for the Wii (with the other Mario Bros games) and started to explore it. The vertical drop start was stupidly annoying but I did eventually get it started this time around - after an inordinate amount of time wastage.In fact, it is no accident copies of SMB2 for the NES are rare. NES hurried SMB3 into production that featured a more natural SMB mechanic and added a sort of modest exploration mechanic too (and stuck in some ace puns like the flute from Legend of Zelda which has a *very* different effect in SMB3). SMB2 faded into well-deserved obscurity.It wasn't just that the game wasn't as much fun as SMB and SMB3, it fought you when it came to figuring out what you were supposed to *do* and that is just poor design.Yes, I get that the game has its fans who think it is the best thing since sliced bread. Good for them. I wouldn't have it any other way. There was a short-lived buzz of interest in the early Nintendo Fun Club magazine (which became Nintendo Power later in life) to prove they are not alone. But to claim this game has all the appeal of its predecessor or successor is stretching the point as far as the buying majority is concerned. Even Spy Hunter is more fun than this game in my opinion.I also know the eventually unveiled \"real history\" of this game, which was irrelevant to me by the time it was made public.

While Super Mario 3 went all out and offered so many ways to play as Mario, the game play is on even level with the last two Mario games. However, the graphics look faded in Super Mario 3 whereas Super Mario 2 contains the best graphics of all three. The biggest downfall of Super Mario 3 is the ridiculous length that it takes to beat the game. I did every area of each world from one to eight, and it took me six hours in one sitting. Although I did it on first try, I still think anyone can beat it because it's not such a hard game to play. That's another positive about Super Mario 3. I forewarn you that certain areas in World Eight are incredibly tough to beat but still attainable. My problem was that I used up all special items before I got to there. Anyone who saved up them for World 8, especially the Super Power Raccoon one, will find them easy to beat no less. I was just stuck with the little Mario the entire time. The final Boss, if reached, will be the easiest to beat, probably of all three games because of one reason, there is always a 1-Up in that one. So, theoretically, that area can be played infinitely until the boss is dead. You don't have to do much with him; just jump in and out of the holes until the boss makes a hole for himself to fall through. All in all, Super Mario 3 is a very easy game to play and beat but nothing to get gaga about.

E Jackson", "helpful": [8, 176], "reviewText": "\"Dear God, please let this horrible game be a figment of my imagination\"Nope, it's real.  What an unbelievable piece of overrated garbage Super Mario Bros. 3 is.  For the life of me I don't get the appeal of this game.  Through each of the eight boring worlds it's just the same thing every time: run to the end of each and every extremely short, uncreative level collecting worthless crap so you can move on to the next short, uncreative level.  Super Mario Bros. 3 is complete baboon poop.  It really is.  Nothing good about this game at all.  No reason for Mario or video game fans to remember this crappy adventure.  No reason for this game to exist.  Thank God there are sensible people out there such as myself to give you the honest truth.Let's get right to the point and talk about all the stinky things:One, and this is the biggest reason Super Mario Bros. 3 isn't any good.  You can only play as Mario and Luigi.  In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as the Princess and Toad in addition to Mario and Luigi.  Not so here.  In this game, Mario and Luigi don't even have anything unique to separate the two, so they are basically the same exact person (except Mario is red and Luigi is green).  Remember how high Luigi can jump in Super Mario Bros. 2?  Well now he jumps just like Mario.  Absolutely no reason for this.  If anything, Luigi should have MANY more interesting things about him this time around since, after all, Super Mario Bros. 3 comes AFTER Super Mario Bros. 2 and you'd think the most logical thing would be to continue adding MORE things with each new series.  But in this case, you get less.  I guess Nintendo FORGOT to make Luigi stand apart from Mario.Another problem: this game is so freakin' predictable.  Gee, after the desert world I go to... a water world?  You don't say!  What?  There's an ICE world and a plant world coming up?  No way!  And what's THIS I see?  The final world will be BIG DARK EVIL FIRE WORLD?  I didn't see THAT coming.  Thanks Nintendo, for making Mario fans look like complete idiots.  Way to go.Other serious problems become noticeable after a couple hours of playtime such as the fact that you have to do so much boring jumping in this game.  You have to jump on top of (or over) SO many things that it becomes an absolute chore after world 3 (if you even MAKE it that far without shutting off the game, that is).  If you find anything exciting about jumping over pipes or jumping on top of goombas or picking up and kicking buzzy beetles, then I recommend seeking professional help.Ok, what else makes Super Mario Bros. 3 suck so much?  It can't get any worse, right?  Yes it can.  After you beat the game a message comes up on the screen that says \"Thank you, but our princess is in another castle.  Just kidding, hahaha\".  You mean to tell me, after all that long, hard and tedious work making it to the very end, Nintendo is going to joke around and make like the adventure isn't over yet?  Before the \"just kidding\" part, you might very well rip apart your controller or punch a hole in your TV screen all because Nintendo wants to play around and pretend there's still more to the adventure.  I can't even think of appropriate words to describe how angry this makes me.  Tears of anger are almost dripping down my face.  Nintendo NEVER should have done that.  I bet that most people who first seen that message really thought the princess was in another castle and came THIS close to killing the nearest living thing next to them.  Bad Nintendo.And guess what?  You have to face one of Bowser's kids at the end of every world.  I'm not kidding.  I was honestly expecting to fight Bowser's WIFE before fighting him, but it never happened.  That's probably for the better.  Who knows how horrific she looks.I'm still trying to figure out what everyone sees in this game.  It's old and forgettable.  Honestly, I think nowadays the only people who enjoy Super Mario Bros. 3 are older folks whose children have moved away to college or to start a family, and they left behind their NES and Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge so their parents had something to do.  All these older folks miraculously happen to enjoy the game so now EVERYONE acts like it's the best game of all-time.

{"reviewerID": "A1ZSOK69XSXF73", "asin": "B00004SVV9", "reviewerName": "Duckman \"Morbid Cynic\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Many gamers consider this the best game in the NES library, and while I won't say that since I don't think I've played a wide enough array of games for that console to come up with such a conclusion, I'll say that this is my favorite game with the Mario title on it.  This is my favorite of all the Mario games since I think among Mario's \"classic\" games, this one is the toughest while still being fun and unlike the two previous Mario games, starts to include features that would be essential to future Mario games.STORYBowser is back to unleash terror, but this time, he's brought his seven children, known as the Koopalings, to wreak havoc in seven kingdoms, and to steal the magic wands from those kingdoms for Bowser's nefarious plans.  Mario and Luigi have to go stop the Koopalings' invasion through their airships, retrieve the stolen magic wands and turn the transformed kings back to normal, and eventually, fight Bowser himself...again.What I find most interesting with this storyline is that unlike most other Mario games, Princess Peach isn't immediately the \"damsel in distress,\" but rather in the beginning of most worlds you enter in the game, she supplies you with a power-up.  It's not until near the end of the game that she gets kidnapped by Bowser.GAMEPLAYSMB3's gameplay is a vast improvement over the previous two games.  If you're familiar with the gameplay mechanics of the first Super Mario Bros. (the American Super Mario Bros. 2 is pretty different, considering that it's merely Doki Doki Panic with Mario characters, and therefore has some pretty different gameplay mechanics, and I don't consider it a true sequel to SMB), then you know around 90% of Super Mario Bros. 3's mechanics.  The right and left buttons on the d-pad make you walk right and left (respectively), Start pauses the game, B launches an attack (if you have a power-up that dishes out attacks), A makes you jump, and the Select button is restricted to the title screen to toggle between 1 and 2-player modes.Throughout the game, you navigate through eight different worlds and have to complete a number of levels until you reach the end of the overworld map (usually you have to beat each level in order to get to the end of the map, but you can sometimes skip a level if there's an alternate, unblocked route), which features a castle with a transformed king and a Toad in distress, asking you to retrieve the magic wand from the Koopaling you have to fight.The eight lands in the order of progression in the game are Grass Land, Desert Land, Water Land, Giant Land, Sky Land, Ice Land, Pipe Land, and Dark Land.  The respective Koopalings you have to fight in these kingdoms are Larry Koopa, Morton Koopa Jr. Wendy O. Koopa, Iggy Koopa, Roy Koopa, Lemmy Koopa, and Ludwig von Koopa (you fight Bowser in Dark Land).  With the exception of Bowser, you fight each of them on giant airships, that are often bristling with cannons and flamethrowers.In the individual levels within the eight worlds you travel, they're quite varied.  There's \"regular\" levels where you travel through a level on the world's surface while jumping over obstacles and defeating enemies.  There's \"sky\" levels where you have to traverse through platforms above a giant bottomless pit, and these are often \"auto-scrolling,\" so make sure you're staying ahead of the screen's movement towards the right.  There's levels where you have to go down a pipe and swim through water, and there's levels where you have to go down a pipe and traverse through an underground level.  Aside from that, there' also smaller castles within each world that you have to beat.  These castles often have lava pools and jumping fireballs much like the castles in the first Mario game, and in the end of each, you have to fight a reptilian creature known as a Boom Boom, though these guys are often easy to defeat.There's also optional places in each world you can visit.  These include \"mushroom houses\" that when you visit them, you choose from one of three chests to pick up a power-up and a location where you try to align three images to win a power-up (the power-ups you can win are a mushroom, leaf, or fireflower).  Sometimes, a moving card will appear on the map and you can play cards to win things like coins, extra lives, and power-ups by flipping cards and matching two of a kind to win something.  Once in a blue moon, a ship will appear on the map and when you get on it, you just collect a ton of coins and you go down a pipe in the end to fight two Hammer Bros..In each map, you'll bump into the Hammer Bros., and when you beat the two of them, you'll get a power-up.There's a smorgasbord of enemies you fight in this game. As usual, you got the Goombas, Koopa Troopas, Piranha Plants, and Buzzy Beetles, but there's some more this time around. Some of the new enemies are the Chain Chomp (when I was a little kid, I thought these were spastic football helmets that hurt you), Boo, Dry Bones (the Koopa Troopa skeletons in the fortresses), baby Piranha Plants (these are capable of jumping), Thwomps (the blocks in the fortresses that try to crush you), and Buster Beetles (the beetles that can throw Ice Blocks at you).There's a bunch of new power-ups as well.  Along with the fireflower, there's the leaf, which allows you to fly after attaining a high-enough speed.  There's also the Tanooki suit, which like the leaf, allows you to fly, but also allows you to turn into a statue for protection against enemies (and can defeat otherwise invincible adversaries like the rotating lights and fireballs in the fortresses).  There's a frog suit that allows you to swim better in underwater levels.  Among the \"best\" power-ups are the P-wing, which is similar to the leaf, but allows you to constantly fly without having to run and fill up the P-meter (and flight ability doesn't run out unless if you get hit by an enemy).  My favorite power-up is the Hammer suit, since this makes you throw hammers that can defeat nearly all enemies (such as the Boos and smashing blocks, which are invincible to tailspin attacks and fireballs), and when you crouch, the shell on the back of your suit protects you from fireball attacks.  Because of how potent the Hammer suit it, it's only natural for it to be the rarest power-up in the game.GRAPHICSSMB3 is a step up in graphics compared to its two predecessors.  Because of the more diverse environments, each world has a distinct visual style.  With the graphical improvements, Mario and Luigi look better than in the previous two games, and the same can be said for all of the creatures in the game.  Also, there's a much wider array of colors used in this game, and this game helped set the stage for what is now Mario's signature polychromatic worlds and creatures (while the first two SMB games had color, the color range wasn't very large).  I think some of the best-looking environments in this game are for Ice Land and Dark Land.  The former for the fact that it really does look and invoke the feeling of a chilly world (and to be humorous, I bet this is what Mario and Luigi would imagine what countries like Russia and Finland are like) and the latter for its really ominous, bleak atmosphere.  Thanks to the wider array of colors, it helps flesh out each world as very distinctive from the other, which is a great thing considering how varied each of the eight worlds are.SOUND/SOUNDTRACKA lot of the sound effects from the first two Mario games have been carried over into SMB3, such as the coin sounds, enemy-smashing sounds, and the fireball sounds.  These sounds are quite effective, given the NES's hardware limitations.The soundtrack for SMB3 is some of Koji Kondo's best work yet.  There's more Overworld themes instead of just one, and the well-known Underworld theme has been \"spiced up\" in this game (and it sounds better).  Two of my favorite themes in this game are the Fortress and Air Ship themes.  The former makes you feel like you're in a hideous dungeon where hundreds of innocents are met with horrible fates and the latter has a percussive, militaristic aesthetic.  In one of the levels in Dark Land, you have to traverse through a squad of tanks, and with the ominous black background and Air Ship theme in the background, it feels like a squad of German heavy tanks is pouring into the Soviet Union circa 1941.COMPLAINTSI only have a few complaints with Super Mario Bros. 3.  My chief complaint with this game is that for how challenging and lengthy it is, there's no saving feature in the game.  So this means you gotta devote a huge chunk of your day to beat this thing since you gotta do it all in one sitting.The difficulty curve among the last three Koopalings is a little off.  Fighting Roy Koopa is pretty difficult since he can shake up the ground, temporarily immobilizing you if you're on the ground.  However, Lemmy is after him, and fighting him is almost as easy as fighting Larry and Morton, but with Ludwig coming after Lemmy, the difficulty spikes up drastically.The other is more minor, but it does irk me a little.  Why are the Boos invincible to fireballs but not so to hammers?  Theoretically, ghosts are supposed to be gaseous entities, so wouldn't fire be a more logical element in defeating them rather than metal projectiles?FINAL WORDThis is surely a classic in the NES library, and easily among the best of all Mario games.  This game is available on the Wii's virtual console (and has been re-issued on various handhelds over the last decade or so), so you can play it on there.  However, if you're more of an old-school gamer, you may find yourself dusting off your NES and SMB3 cartridge to play this one again.  Regardless of what method you like to play this game on, give it another whirl.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My favorite of all Mario games.  94%", "unixReviewTime": 1343606400, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2012"}

So much to my surprise, Super Mario Bros. 3 MORE than passed my expectations!  It is 99.9% flawless -- the 0.1% is attributed to not being able to save your game along the way.  (This would, of course, be corrected on Super Mario All-Stars for the Super NES/Wii.)EVERYTHING about this game is completely spectacular -- the graphics, soundtrack, sound effects, background schemes, the new enemies/bosses you encounter (including Bowser and his 7 children -- WHAT?!), and certainly not least -- the new costumes that Mario gets to wear!  My favorite is the Tanooki Suit because you can swing your tail to defeat those nasty Goombas -- PLUS you can turn Mario into a statue to make him invincible (hold down and the B button to take effect).  The Frog suit is extremely helpful for the water levels.  My favorite worlds to conquer are World 3 (Water World), World 4 (Giant World), World 6 (Ice World), and World 7 (Plant World).So to anyone that HASN'T played this game yet, what are you waiting for?!

This is still an incredible game no matter how old it gets. You play as Mario or if you're the second player, you play as his brother Luigi. Together... or one at a time... you take on 8 worlds or areas or lands and each land / area / world has a specific theme like ice, desert, giant, pipe or water and each has several levels. The map of each land will lead you to levels where the real game is. Each level is a sidescrolling platformer where A button is the jump, holding B will make you run, left, right and down will make you move or duck. You will soon jump on enemies to defeat them and get powerups. First the super mushroom that makes you bigger and take a second hit, then you will get the racoon leaf or fire flower. The leaf will let you bat a tail with the B button and allow you to fly if you have enough of a runway. The fireflower belts out bouncing fireballs with the press of the B button. There are other special suits and powerups like the Takooni suit, Frog suit and Hammer brother suit all with special abilities.The levels feel brief when compared to later Mario games, but they're still very fun. The land map will lead you to levels, fortresses, toad houses, special mini games to get more lives and the airship where the boss of each land is hiding. Also in the map you can use items you've collected along the way to make walking into a level easier.When its all said and done, this game has memorable levels, enemies and bosses. Fun powerups, simple yet challenging gameplay. Good graphics for the time and a diverse set of foes.

Some levels are avoidable, some are not, but you can also do special areas (several mini-games and an area where you get bonus items).  You are able to get items throughout the game, and you can use them before levels to be stronger.  There are also several different suits that augment your abilities.  The most common is the Racoon suit which allows you to kill the enemies by flicking your tail at them, and also giving you the ability to fly for short periods of time. There is also a frog suit (allowing swimming to be easier), a Tanooki suit (much like the raccoon suit, but you can briefly turn to stone to avoid enemies...rare), and I believe there is a Hammer Brothers Suit (but I could be wrong about this one....my memory is a little hazy).

In 1989 when they announced that SM 3 will be coming to the US/Canada in 1990, gamers were excited including myself after reading about it in Nintendo power and i was anticipating for this game as i loved the first 2 despite part 2 not actually being a REAL Mario game as any Mario fan would know, during that year in December of 1989 many kids of the 80s including me when i was 8 saw The Wizard in theaters which was produced by Nintendo and at the climax of that filmed showed the awesome sneak preview footage of this game during the challenge which had every kid drooling for the game. On Feburary of 1990 after 2 months of anticipation the game finally came and it delivered. I remembered getting this for my 9th birthday back in June that year and i was playing it nearly all summer for it became my fave NES game ever and even had the merchandise to eating the food products and watching the toon.After \"Super Mario Brothers 2\" which was great but very different from the first game since SMB 2 was the REAL SMB 2 but actually just another game with Mario characters, SMB 3 returned to the classic formula and with new improvements so far. Not only did this game became a best-seller since then but also a game that defined childhoods including mine! this game offered new stuff like power-ups, new moves, new features and 8 rich worlds with many levels to explore. It pushed the limits of 8-bit games at the time as it boosted enough chips to power it, it even introduced the map system with mini-games thrown in. In this game you get a new thing called silly suits ranging from a Raccoon which when you touch the magic leaf you turn into a half raccoon person and can fly which has became famous since then to the Hammer Brothers suit which you can throw hammers at enemies to even hide in the shell.The graphics and sound are very good but the All-Stars remake and Gameboy Advanced versions are even better despite this game does have it's charms with the chunky pixel 8-bit look and the controls are excellent as well.

It was released back in 1990, during the prime of the NES. It was a game that proved that &quot;hi-fi&quot; technology (like the Sega Genesis) wasn't needed to make a game great. Shigeru Miyamoto managed to utilise every inch of the NES hardware to produce what is probably the best-selling video game cartridge of all time. So enchanting and addictive is Super Mario Bros. 3, that in EGM magazine's 100th issue four years ago, it was chosen as the second best video game of all time!After failing to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom, Bowser has started creating turmoil in the Mushroom World. He has used a flying ship to travel through the seven lands of the world and transform the ruler of each land into an animal by means of a magic wand. So Mario &amp; Luigi have not only to travel to the Dark Land where Bowser lurks, but also to transform the kings back to normal. For the first time ever, the game makes use of a &quot;land map&quot; in which levels are spread out, so that it's easier to follow the progress you make. Each land has it's own unique map complete with action scenes, bonus games which help you by providing items for the road and a fortress at the end. In each fortress reside each of the Koopa kids with the magic wands. Although this was the biggest Mario adventure till Super Mario World was released a year later, it's not necessary to complete each and every level. If you manage to find an elusive flute, you can warp between each land. But only three lands per flute, otherwise it would become cheap.The visuals were splendid for its day. I only find fault with the underground areas, because they can get a bit tedious and monotonous. The music is memorable. Each land has its own unique theme which beautifully suits the type of land. For example, Desert Land has a trudgy sort of beat, whereas Ice Land has a soothing tune. There's even a &quot;funky&quot; version of the original underground theme. This game has power-ups galore! The mushrooms and fireflower are back along with a leaf power-up (which let's you fly) and special suits. These suits come in very handy during some levels. For example, the frog suit allows better underwater maneuvering (but is clumsy on dry land) and the cute &quot;tanooki&quot; suit enables Mario to turn into a statue for a short time. There are a few more surprises too! Add to this the ability to keep and use items in stock (upto twenty eight, I think!) and you have all you could possibly ask for in that area.As for the gameplay, what can I say? It's perfect! Mario controls very smoothly, but not too much as to ruin it. Flying is performed by equipping the leaf and running till the bar at the bottom fills up. When it is full a whistle will sound, signifying that its time to take off! This game was meant to be completed in one sitting, so it lacks a save feauture. The game would have been less exciting if it was present. Challenge-wise it offers just the right amount of challenge without making it tough as nails or cheap. Enjoy Dark Land!For those of you who didn't comprehend what I said above, here is the bottom line: If you still have an NES collecting dust, definitely buy this game. You couldn't possibly regret it. If you have a SNES, then you can enjoy the Super Mario All-Stars version of this game, which has better graphics and sound and a save feature! I prefer Super Mario World to this because it's much more eye-candy, has better sound effects, has a save feature and Yoshi, but that's only a personal opinion.

Super Mario Bros 3 (SMB3) was a noble effort back in the day, and really pushes the idea of what an NES game can be with intricate level layouts, maps, characters, items, and play mechanics. It also has a great graphical style that's uniquely its own. No other SMB game has ever looked liked this.But when it comes to actual gameplay, it leaves me a bit wanting. My biggest complaint is the levels are *really* short. Even when later levels try to present you with challenges you can often just force your way through and still make it, because safety isn't far away. Nintendo chose quantity over quality, as there's certainly a lot of them. But when you don't have enough meat on any one level to bite into, it makes the game hard to get into.Another big let down are the bosses. They're all almost identical (there's a template &quot;sub-boss&quot; form that all sub-bosses base their patterns on and a template &quot;level boss&quot; form that all level bosses base their patterns on. All sub/level bosses use the same (or extremely similiar) sprites too. All easily squashed with the standard 3 hits Miyamoto always requires.I think SMB3 is just a case of Nintendo getting too caught up in the interface, items, graphics, etc and kinda forgetting about the gameplay. Try SMB2 instead. Either the vastly strange American version that's decidedly un-Mario but an incredibly well made platformer all the same, or the Japanese SMB2 which is basically SMB1 on steroids.

Like the original Super Mario Brothers, SMB3 became one of the biggest selling games ever.  SMB3 also brought a lot of new innovations to the Mario series, many of which can still be found today.  SMB3 regularly charts both player and critic polls as being among the best video games ever released.Released [in at the end of 1988] October 3, 1988 in Japan, SMB3 became one the Famicon's biggest sellers.  America had to wait for over a year from when Japan got it.  Originally released in some Nintendo arcade machines before it even hit stores, the buzz soon spread about the game.  This buzz was helped by the ninety minute commercial known as THE WIZARD (some people insist that it is a movie proper, but it's little more than a Nintendo advertisement) in which the climax of the movie - er, commercial - is the unveiling of SMB3, as well as revealing the secret location to the one of the warp whistles.  America finally got its hands on the game in released February 12, 1990.The game went on to sell approx. eighteen million copies, and when you include the reissues and rereleases with SUPER MARIO ALL STARS and SUPER MARIO ADVANCED, this figure swells to over thirty three million copies.  And what makes SMB3 such a successful, highly regarded title?  Read on.For the second* officially released sequel to the biggest selling game of all time, Nintendo didn't pull any stops when it came to crafting this game.  Returning to the familiar environments and gameplay of the original title, rather than the radical reinvention of SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, Nintendo greatly widened Mario's moves and gamestyle.  The Fire-flower and starman return.  Nintendo introduces Mario's famous raccoon suit, which enables Mario to fly briefly, and greatly opens up what is possible in level design.  New suits and powerups also include the Tanooki suit, which enables Mario to become a stone statue, a Frog suit for swimming, and Hammer Brothers suit, which enables Mario to shoot hammers.One of the biggest innovations was the inclusion of an overall game map, where Mario would move between levels.  Nintendo also used the concept (in a much different setting with a much different effect) in ZELDA II: THE ADVENTURE OF LINK, though in that title the overworld was much more important and you had a lot more freedom.  Here, the map served as a level grid in which to progress through the eight worlds.  SMB3 returns to the eight world format of the original game, rather than the seven world format of SMB2.The level design itself is where SMB3 truly shines.  First off, Nintendo returned to the original game for its basic game mechanics but [induing] ensuring Mario has a whole new bag of tricks to beat the nasty Bowser and his koopa kids.  While staying true to the overall atmosphere and play of the original title, Nintendo, over the course of eight worlds, features platforming levels that ingeniously use the game's new suits and powerups to fully integrate the player into the game's world.  Each of the eight levels is themed.  The first world is grass lands.  The second world is desert (much like the second and sixth world in SMB2).  The third is the water levels.  Where the castle is on the overworld map for World 3 is roughly a map of Japan and Tokyo.  The fourth world is the land of giants.  The fifth is the Skylands.  The sixth is frozen tundra, all ice.  The seventh is Pipeland, and the eight is Bowser's world, featuring lava, tricky airships, and challenging levels.SMB3 also introduces the seven children of King Kooper (whose the mother???), each of which rule one of the worlds and which at the end of each world you must fight in an airship.  Other innovations include minigames, new enemies (many of which would feature prominently in later titles), and the aforementioned suits.A good portion of NES games are notorious for being extremely difficult.  Some titles are damn near impossible (BATTLE TOADS, NINJA GAIDEN III), and others are filled with cheap shots and just unforgiving, unreasonable difficulty (the original MEGA MAN).  In fact, the original sequel to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS (known everywhere but Japan as THE LOST LEVELS) went unreleased in its original format stateside or in Europe for twenty one years due to difficulty and too similar to the original game.  We only just now got the title via the Virtual Console on the Wii.Fortunately, SMB3 has a very intuitive difficulty level.  As each world progresses, so does the difficulty of the levels, which culminates in the last world of Bowser, which does have some hard patches.  Overall, however, SMB3 has a medium range of difficulty, and while there are some tricky parts here and there, the game is not really that difficult and most players will be able to beat it given enough time.  Not giving too much away, SMB3 also jokingly refers to the original title after you beat Bowser, with the first words out of Princess Toadstool's mouth is \"Thank you Mario, but our princess is in another castle . . . just kidding.\"  Strangely enough, they cut this joke in the SUPER MARIO ADVANCED reissue.Overall, SMB3 stands as one of the gaming industry's most outstanding achievements, and is one of the corner stones of the Mario Series.  As much as I love SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, SMB3 really felt like the true sequel to the original game, and Mario went out with a blaze of glory on the original NES with this title.  One of the greatest games ever.*Though this is the second sequel to be released and that the general public knew about, this was actually the fourth officially licensed sequel to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS.  The first, developed by Hudson Soft with Nintendo's permission, was a game called SUPER MARIO BROTHERS SPECIAL, which appeared on the obscure NEC PC-8801 in Japan only.  This is the truly forgotten Mario game, the real lost levels if you will.  Due to technical limitations, it does not scroll and the hit detection is rather off.  Nintendo had nothing to do with its development.  The second sequel is SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, released in 1986.  This title was released only in Japan.  The game was just like SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, but much harder.  Howard Lincoln of HOWARD AND NESTOR fame (anyone who had Nintendo Power back in the 1980s knows what I am talking about) hated the title, so they took a Japanese game called Doki Doki Panic, changed some sprites, and in 1988 released the American version of SUPER MARIO  BROTHERS 2.------------------.-----[This was written separate from the review back in May 2012 about the Mario games' development history. Notably, Miyamoto said that \"Super Mario World\" began development with a team of sixteen people, and took about three years to make. As \"Super Mario World\" came out in November 1990, that means Nintendo began production on this game sometime in 1987 - the same year they were working on \"Super Mario Bros. 3\". On a game forum someone asked why Nintendo did not release \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" on the SNES, instead of the NES, and was complaining they should have released the game on the more powerful system. This was my answer:]Let's look at some Mario history, shall we? SMB3 came out in Japan in October 1988. That means it was completed, finished, and ready to be published by that point in time.If you look at the Japanese publication dates, SMB came out in 1985, Lost Levels came out in 1986, Doki Doki Panic came out in 1987, and SMB3 came out in late 1988. Given the fact the game was finished and released by 1988 I would hardly call that \"late in the NES hardware cycle\". Actually, the NES had only been out three years when SMB3 hit Japan, although the Famicom came out in late 1983. However all the heavy hitters for the Famicom came out in 1985 and beyond.Essentially all Nintendo had to do at this point was release it on cart; the code was written and completed. If have a sequel to the biggest game for your console, and the sequel SMB2 is also a massive hit - why wouldn't they release SMB3 which was already completed and published in Japan? They had a massive financial interest in getting this game out.There are very few differences between the Japanese SMB3 and the western SMB3 (namely if Mario gets hit with a powerup he goes to little Mario rather than Super Mario, ala Mario with a mushroom). There's nothing like the major differences between the Japanese and the Western versions of Zelda II The Adventure of Link.All four 8-bit NES titles were completed in a three year period, 1985-1988 (and were published in Japan as well, though SMB2, there called SMB USA, came out in 1992).I've read SMB3 took about two to three years to program, meaning Nintendo began work on it possibly by late 1985 (though that does sound entirely too early) but definitely by early 1987 and possibly even late 1986 given it was released in October 1988 and both Doki Doki and Lost Levels would have been finished (in the case of Doki Doki, it would have been closed to being completed if not already completed).In comparison today, that would be like saying Nintendo should not have released \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" back in 2009 (three years into the Wii lifecycle) because obviously the Wii U is coming up and they should save it for a new system. The timeframe is the same. And according to your logic, for this generation we definitely SHOULD NOT have gotten Skyward Sword for the Wii, despite the fact it has had a five year development timeframe was began shortly after Twilight Princess came out..I do find it strange that they had problems with Yoshi (which for the record Miyamoto has said he wanted to put in the original 1985 SMB). After all, Hudson's Adventure Island series, the same company responsible for the abomination that is Super Mario Bros. Special, the first ever sequel to the Mario franchise, were able to get ridable dinasaurs, and the 1993 Capcom title Little Nemo Dream Master had ridable creatures too.Then again, Adventure Island II came out in April 1991, two and a half years after SMB3.Basically, I said all that to say you should research your Mario history more. When Nintendo began development on SMB3 (late 1986/early 1987) the Super NES was nowhere on the horizon, at least not publically. Even in late 1988 when the game was published, we were still over two years away from the Super Famicom which came out in Japan in November of 1990.So that's why they didn't develop it for the Super Famicom.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of Nintendo's many masterpieces, essential gaming for the video game enthusiast", "unixReviewTime": 1191369600, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2007"}

It is indeed mandatory to your understanding of what 'Tanooki' refers to and to what a 'Hammer Suit' is and how tough and long the 'Dark World' is before reaching Bowser's castle. I suggest you watch some old commercials of Mario Bros. 3 on Youtube and see just how popular and anticipated this game was back in the day. In fact, an entire movie was made to advertise this game before it's initial release. The movie was called 'The Wizard', by the way, but that's just one example of how popular this game was and still is. Now, the product itself arrived in a very clean and in (practically) brand new condition. There's a slight glitch when putting it in my NES every now and then, but it's nothing disastrous. A little adjustment is all it needs before I can guide Mario (or Luigi) on his quest to save Princess Toadstool (now Peach) from Bowser and his 7 Koopaling children. The game is in fact very similar to Super Mario World on the SNES, so if you've played that awesome game, then you'll know that SMB 3 is just as fun. What I like about this game is that there is no 'save system', so you can't save the game, turn the power off, and come back later and begin where you left off. On the contrary, you must play the whole game in one sitting, which can be very quick or very long, depending on your knowledge of the various shortcuts and secrets this game has to offer. Or, you can simply pause the gameplay and come back later. But I would suggest making time to play this game, because you may end up playing through your lunch break out of sheer enjoyment.

Not very detailed, I know, but the writing is not important and isn't treated as if it is.GRAPHICSI think this game still looks fantasic.  The colors are vibrant, the design of the levels is genius, the characters and enemies look detailed and move well.

Unfortunatley, I had to wait sveral months later on my 7th birthday and I immediatley popped this sucker into the NES and was warped into a adventure of my own.  Super Mario 3 is the first two Mario games morphed into one ultimate package and then it was injected with steriods because this game is a supernatural high!  The bosses were King Koopa's 7 kids who guarded 7 ships after turning one king into 7 different animals on 7 different occasions and its up to Mario and Luigi to hop, jump, fly, swim, shoot, and hammer their way through 7 different worlds to obtain 7 different wands to save the king from the 7 kooplings.  Just when you thought defeated all the kooplings, King Koopa himself sends you a message that he kidnapped Princess Toadstool at his castle in the Dark World (the 8th world).  Who knew that a Mario game would have a magic leaf that turns Mario into a racoon that allows him to fly over a short period of time or a hammer brother suit that allows Mario to shoot mulitple hammers that inflicts more damage than a fireball.  You also get a inventory of items (obtained from Toad's house or from a chest in random parts of the game) from fire flowers to a P Wing (allows Mario to fly past the entire board when things get reall rough down below).  This game is filled with many secrets that no gamer has discovered before such as how to get a warp zone recorder and a strategy on how to easily get 99 lives on World 3.

Second, it was made in 1990! Why do gamers constantly try and compare old classics with today's standards in areas that they KNOW old classics can't match (Graphics, lentgh, sound etc.)?

I had to have the original copy. The bad news was, my parents would not buy me a Nintendo Entertainment System.

The good news was that my parents had fought to get a Wii back when Wiis were a must-have. I quickly downloaded it and started playing. I played it almost every day (Along with Super Mario 64, the same way I played Mario 3). Then I bought almost every old Mario game and played it on the Wii. Super Mario Bros. 3 was still the best. When I got my own laptop I was very intersted in what was hidden in Mario 3 (beta content Nintendo did not remove). I found over 10 levels that I could not even access without hacking, and spent part of that summer entering codes that allowed me to play those levels. After a while I discovered other franchises like Sonic and Zelda. In those franchises were games that were just as impressive as Mario 3. My parents decided to buy me a Nintendo Entertainment System, so I had even more games to play. I forgot about Mario 3's thrills and fun. Then my uncle came to visit my family in 2012. He saw Mario Bros. 3 on the Wii Menu and asked if he could play it with me. We started a new game and played it all day. Then we played it the next day. That is where the game started to defy time.

Today, whenever a major sequel in a franchise is coming out, many video game store locations have \"midnight release\" parties, we see trailers for the game on the internet, a dramatic unveiling at the E3 convention, and even commercials that may or may not feature product tie-in's. This, today is pretty common. However, back during the olden days of the late 80's and early 90's, these hype machinations did not exist. However, one game truly did generate even more significant hype than any game has yet to achieve. That game, is Super Mario Brothers 3.I remember a television commercial for this game that used to air before the release. In the commercial (you can still view this commercial on youtube), you see a guy yelling Mario's name in the street. He is joined by many others also yelling Mario's name. The camera pans out and you see the whole world is yelling for Mario, and the people were wearing colored t-shirts so that they all collectively form Mario's face, visible from outer space. This commercial is actually quite symbolic, since this is the one game from this era that really did have a global fanbase anticipating it. Mario 3 would be endorsed via McDonald's happy meal toys, Chips A'Hoy cookies, and even the film The Wizard (starring Fred Savage, Chrisian Slater, and Beau Bridges) centers around our first glimpse of Super Mario Brothers 3 as the climactic scene in the movie. To say that fans all over the world were extremely eager to play this game would be a massive understatement. So how does the most hyped-up game ever (both then and today) fare considering all the hype?This is the one game that not only lives up to all of it's incredible hype, but even surpasses it by leaps and bounds. The game was lovingly received by critics and fans alike whom all agreed that Mario 3 was indeed the definitive title for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game shattered sales records, and even today if you ask anyone that had and played a Nintendo during their childhood, they will tell you that one of their favorite games was Super Mario Brothers 3.So what makes this game so great? It is packed with 8 worlds with multiple levels, each following a different theme such as a world of ice levels, a world of water levels, a world with lots of pipes in each level, etc. Mario also has tons of new power-ups, such as a raccoon suit, a frog suit to make swimming easier, and even a hammer brothers suit that has a fireproof shell! On top of that, Mario can pick and choose when to use his items. There are lots of mini-games as well, like the memory card mini game and the match-up game. This game also introduces us to the Koopa Kids, Bowser's 7 children whom each have stolen a magic wand and taken over a world. To move on to the next world, Mario will have to make it to the end of the world, board the Koopa Kids' flying gunship, and then defeat the Koopa Kid (Larry, Morton, Wendy, Iggy, Roy, Ludwig, and Lemmy Koopa).One of the newest and coolest additions to this game that thrilled gamers was Mario being able to fly for the first time. Gamers delighted in taking Mario to the sky with the help of his raccoon tail, and the game was filled with tons of secret areas in the sky, in underground pipes, or by bouncing on hidden blocks.The secrets aspect of the Mario games was really 1-upped here. In the original Mario games, there were a few scattered secrets here and there. In this game, almost every level has at least one major secret. This leads to hours of great gameplay to discover how to find all the really cool and rare hidden items in the game, such as the anchor, the whistle, and the hammer brothers suit.For two players, this game was the ultimate in video game fun. In the original Super Mario Brothers, a player would have to wait for another player to either die or beat the game before it would be the other's turn. This resulted in some long waits that might be frustrating, especially if you were playing alongside a Mario master. In Super Mario Brothers 3, the players alternate turns and will essentially find themselves competing for levels with rewarding secrets and mushroom huts with special items. Extremely competitive players can also challenge the other player for their turn and even steal their end-of-level cards to get 1-Ups. To steal another player's turn, you would have to best them in a mini-game that is essentially a level from the original Mario Brothers arcade game. Competing for turns could be tons of fun, and some games I would find myself just constantly challenging the other player to the minigames.This game represents hours of great gameplay and even after mastering the game can still be great fun as you and another player compete against one another for a better game or higher score. You really can't say enough about how awesome a gaming experience this was for Nintendo players back in the early 90's. This game packed so much in terms of graphics, levels, and sprites into a single cartridge that it really is an incredible gaming achievement.Over the years, many great games for various consoles have come and gone, and we always remember them fondly and talk about their legacy from time to time. So many consoles have come out since the original Nintendo Entertainment System, that in hindsight we define the greatness of these consoles by only a few games. For the Nintendo Entertainment System, the 8-bit era's pinnacle of greatness will always be remembered as Super Mario Brothers 3.-paris", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super Mario Brothers 3 : The Top Nintendo Game", "unixReviewTime": 1321056000, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2011"}

You got to change your turtle within a mission and select different weapons that you collect along the way.  The music was good, especially when considering the time period of this game.  Some might this as a burden, but I enjoyed its difficulty.  As I've said in my other reviews, this game was made back in the day when NES games kicked your [...] and forced you to defeat it on its own terms.  When comparing this to the much easier 2,3, and 4, I enjoyed this much better (but I still like the others for their multiplayer ability, don't get me wrong).THE BADWhile this was difficult and I enjoyed it, there were some things that do place a detriment to the game.  The turtles are uneven in their abilities.  Leonardo has a long reach, but is the weakest of the four (why do that to my favorite turtle?!).  Mikey is not much better than Leo in terms of weapon power.  Raphael is good for his fast attacks despite his up-close range.  Donatello pretty much defeats all of them because he is the strongest AND has the farthest reach.  You could beat this game on him alone.If you're a fan of the Old School NES, you will no doubt enjoy this game (or perhaps just a fan of the Ninja Turtles in general).  It's a good platform game that is unique in comparison to the sequels that followed.  Today's gamers will no doubt turn away from it because of its dated graphics (which aren't bad, especially considering the time period) and its more difficult levels.\"It's too hard!\"Well, I suggest you try harder.

{"reviewerID": "A36UKFV79879MD", "asin": "B00004SVVH", "reviewerName": "BX Lounger", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Near the late '80s, the Turtles franchise was taking off after starting out as a comic book series. The transition from comic books to the TV screen proved to be successful. After the excellent arcade game came out, Ultra Games (or Konami as we all found out afterwards) announced and then released Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the NES. Of course, it sold very well based on the brand recognition but it divided up the fans when it came to who liked the game and who didn't. It was not a port of the arcade game but rather an original action game with open world game play elements mixed in. To this day, some called it a classic, while others called it average. I side with the latter as it could have been much better.In this game, you take control of all four turtles from the get go. Each turtle has his own weapon, health bar and were able to use weapons such as scrolls, etc. You had to navigate through 6 stages with goals to complete before you were able to face the boss at the end of each stage. There were two views of action in the game: the top down, overhead perspective like Zelda II: The Adventure of Link and the regular side scrolling view where you walked from left to right and vice versa. There were weapon and pizza icons to pick up to help you along the way. If you died using a turtle, you start at the beginning of the stage with the next turtle available. The game did offer you a chance to \"rescue\" your turtle on some stages in certain places so as you were able to find him. When you die using all of the turtles, the game is over and you are allowed three continues before you start from the beginning of the game.The PROS: The graphics were decent enough and the overall presentation is okay. The controls were easy to use as alternating between the turtles proved no problems to be had. The music was also pretty good to listen to. Ultra Games used most of the enemies from the TV show and added new ones to populate the stages. Several villains also made appearances here like Bebop, Rocksteady, Mecha Turtle and of course Shredder. You were given control of all of the turtles from the get go and had to manage their weapon count and health bars. This added strategy as you'll use a combination of them at certain points in the game. There are six stages in total and while it sounds like it's not a lot for a game, they were all rather long. Plus, it was incredibly difficult, which pleased some gamers.The CONS: I borrowed this game from my best friend at the time and beat it in a week; the hardest week I ever experienced back then. Here's why:Every stage had objectives to complete. Sometimes, you can use the map when you hit the start button and see the location for some objectives; others you were left on your own to find it. Second, the game never offered any hints so you had to roam the open world parts to find out which way you would go. Third, the game demanded precise jumping skills so it was common to try again and again to cross small and large gaps. TMNT had gained a reputation for being one of the most difficult games to beat (the underwater section in the 2nd stage, the spiked walls closing in on you in the 4th stage & facing off against the Technodrome in the 5th stage are examples of intense sections players had to pass through.) Finally, TMNT had one of the WORST game endings.....ever. The feeling I had after I played it every day for a week and then seeing it for myself was of disappointment and anger; I realized it was not worth it and never ever played it again.Some players had fond memories of this game when they were younger. I didn't and while it was popular for a while, that didn't excuse it from the areas that needed work. The top down perspective wasn't helpful, the game didn't offer any hints as to where to go, you had three continues to beat the entire game and it was brutally difficult in certain sections that frustrated many players. Having one of the worst endings ever in a game was inexcusable and that was only seen by those who actually completed the game like myself.

I was never able to get past the 3rd level. I tried for years to advance, but when you lose all your lives you have to restart all over again and I don't think anyone had the patience to do it again... once the SNES came into play this game became a forgotten classic.Now, 2 million light years since then, I recently found myself playing it again on the PC (emulator + rom) and decided it was a part of my past that was left opened that I had to complete to regain feeling in my left nut again.I played it for about 5 mins and thought \"#### this\" so I looked for some Game Genie codes to stay invincible and stuff and I have actually managed to beat this game! So it is possible, and it's even still hard to beat when you are invincible... if you have ever beaten this game without cheating, then my hats off to you and a quick flip off and congratulations.Looking at it now, It makes me wonder if the game was actually meant to be a TMNT game or if the developers where just keen to cash in on the name and just added the TMNT to a game already being developed. I wonder that because the game really has nothing at all to do with the TMNT's unless it was based off the comics, which I highly doubt. There are some familiar faces like the four turtles, April and Splinter, and the villains, Bebop, Rock steady,  Mousers and about a million Rat Kings who wasn't even really a villain in the series. But then there is about 1000 different enemies that are not related to anything ever seen in the series, such as bulldozers, men of fire, walking eyeballs, balloons that drop bombs, weird pink spiders... I guess they could say the forces of Dimension X where at play, but there is no mention of it in the game. Krangs not in it, but there are bad guys that sort of look like that small Chicken walker thing he had.It just makes me wonder if this game was being developed as something else and then they decided, \"hey, lets put the TMNT into this thing\" Once you defeat the Techno drome that is one 8th the size of the cartoon one, you can fight off shredder and then reach one of those quick endings that basically say, \"well, all that hard work was a waste of time, thanks for playing\" in fact the end is a joke, I wont spoil it, give an emulator with game genie codes active a go and see for yourself if you're curious... it was lame, lame, lame... probably lasted 8 seconds.This might've been where it started, but I prefer the Arcade version over any of them.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "One of those games impossible to beat without a game-genie", "unixReviewTime": 1152489600, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2006"}

They had spawned a successful comic book series, a television show, three feature length movies, and other related merchandise.  They were even featured in Pizza Hut advertisements.So it was natural someone would feature them in a NES game.Enter Ultra, a shadow company of Konami.  Ultra was a subsidary of Konami and created for the sole purpose of publishing more NES titles than Nintendo allowed a developer to publish in any given year.There was already an arcade game as a four player beat'em up released in Japan when Ultra released TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  in North America.  Rather than do a port of that title, Ultra developed their own title.  The arcade port would be released as TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  II: The Arcade Game.  Although billed as a sequel, the port of the arcade title had nothing to do with the original NES game, and had much different gameplay.  Instead of four player, the NES TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  II had two player.  Otherwise the game as largely identical to the original arcade title.The game proved very popular back in the day.  This video game would even appear in the 1989 NES commercial posing as a feature length Hollywood film called THE WIZARD. (Interestingly enough, Lucas (\"I love the Power Glove.  It is so bad!\") is now a convicted felon due to sex crimes.)  It's great to hear Beau Bridges complain about the Technodrome!  It's even better to read Roger Ebert's review of THE WIZARD where he discusses the games as well.The overall gamestyle is either top down perspective or sidescrolling, and this title uses both constantly and interchangeably, similar to ZELDA II, although there is more to do in the overworld perspective than ZELDA II..The game features all four turtles as playable characters from the start.  You are able to switch out any turtle at any time (provided they are still alive and have energy).  Leonardo has medium range sword attacks.  Raphael has the worst attack range but has the very powerful attack.  Michelangelo has medium range and power but is the fastest turtle (and the best to use in the infamous water stage).  Donatello is by far the best turtle to use due to his attack range and power, almost making the other three turtles obsolete at best.Like previous reviewers have noted, the game strangely lacks any major enemy characters from the franchise, which is a rather strange omission given the fact Konami was marketing this product and kids obsessed with the turtles.  For bosses, Bebop, Rockseady, Turtle Van, Blimp, the Technodrome, and Shredder are the only main characters from the franchise that make an appearance.  Where is Krang (my personal favorite), Leatherhead, the Rat King, Casey Jones, etc?  Nowhere to be found.The game overall is short and brutal.  You only get three continues.  There are only six (long stages), but trust me, those stages will have you pulling your hair out at the end.  Although there have been complaints about the controls, they are not THAT bad.  The Angry Video Game Nerd has shown in his famous review of this title a spot where you must jump over a certain hole in the floor that you actually just run over.  That is the exception, though, not the rule.  Overall the play control is rather good.Like several NES games, \"TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES \" features a stage notorious for its difficulty.  \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" is rather infamous for the water stage where you must guide the turtles through an insanely challenging swimming level where you must disarm explosives before the bad guys blow up a dam. TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  gives you 2:20 minutes to swim through this underwater labyrinth in an attempt to disarm the bombs. You must avoid water currents, electric beams, pink seaweed that is very difficult to avoid.  Other stages that are difficult are Stage Four, the spiked wall sequence, and the final boss.The difficulty and the length of this game was in line with other titles and these features were rather common in that era.  Other famous difficult levels from the NES era are 8-3 from the original \"Adventure Island\", the \"Battletoads'\" racing level and snakes level, \"Ninja Gaidens\" 6-2 and beyond, and the Yellow Devil boss from the original \"Mega Man\".  The games were just hard as balls back then and short.  The length was due largely to the technology of the timeThe reviewer who complained about the ending being \"the worst\" he has ever seen is rather laughable.  It is a NES game, after all.  Overall, the endings to NES titles were always rather lame.  As far as the \"worst\", I would probably nominate GHOST AND GOBLINS, because after beating the game, you discover you have literally been tricked by Satan (!), and the only way to see the \"true\" ending is to go back and beat the game a second time.  As that game is damn near impossible, this ending just adds insult too injury.  How Capcom ever got Satan past Nintedo's censors (who wanted all religious content removed from North American NES video games)  I guess we'll never know.  Shigeru Miyamoto's 1983 DEVIL WORLD even went unreleased in the United States due to the title.For availability, obviously you can get the game used for your NES or emulate (which may be safer for your controller, as you can save state your way through the more difficult sections).  Nintendo also sanctioned the title's rerelease in the Wii's Virtual Console (the greatest invention in the history of mankind, if I do say so myself!), although TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  is 600 points rather than the standard 500 points for NES titles due to licensing issues.Although now in the twenty plus years the game has been out, it has become favorable to blast the game for its difficulty and other perceived offenses (largely due to the AVGN review), it helps to remember that TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES sold over four million copies when first released, making it one of the most successful third party NES titles ever.  Nintendo Power gave this game their Game of the Year award in 1989 as well.Much like ZELDA II: THE ADVENTURE OF LINK, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES was a tremendously popular game, and much of the hostility present toward the title in the present gaming culture was not present back in the late 1980s (though this is probably more true of ZELDA II than TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES ).Although difficult and sometimes frustrating, this is one of the great NES titles.  The video game website IGN rated this title as the 98th greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Tremendously popular when released, still good today", "unixReviewTime": 1325980800, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2012"}

I was a big Turtles fan, so I did'nt care.  It was fun selecting different Turtles (who varied in speed, damage in Turtle weapons, and range in Turtle weapons), and picking up and using different ninja weapons such as boomerangs, shierikens, and TNT (best weapon), other than your main weapons.  Graphics (for its time) were awesome and so was the music score and the controls.  I love that.  I only gave this game three stars because I do have 3 major complaints about the game.-1. It was way too difficult.  Even with your Nintendo Power Strategy Guide, you had to play this game 50 times to master beating it.  I think this game went beyond the levels of difficulty such as how easy it was for the Turtle to die and the random changing groups of enemies throughout the game (making it hard for you to strategize your attack or moves).  Even though it had some of the dark elements from the comics, the game was suppose to be for kids so there was no reason for the high levels of difficulty.-2 Choice of characters was my main problem with this game.  The cartoon series was already on their second seaon when they were designing this game.  I sense that they were trying to mix in the cartoon series (Bebop, Rocksteady, and The Technodrome) with adding more elements of the darker comics, but when the hell were flying missle balloons, flying robot heads, chainsaw guy, frog man, fireman, butterflies, MechaTurtle and flying astronauts appear in the ninja turtles universe?!?  How uncreative!There were alot of Ninja Turtle enemies to choose from, but omitting Krang really took the cake.  It was great fighting the moving Techonodrome, but there would be NO TECHNODROME without Krang!  I don't think they did the proper marketing research before making and releasing this game.-3 You don't hear the Ninja Turtles theme music anywhere in the game.  What copyright contraints were the developers under!?  As a child, I was confused.Other than the three complaints, the game was playable and it would be much better to use game genie to beat it.  I know its cheating, but its more fun that way and it was the only way I was able to beat the game.  Although this game was a hit, Ultra/Konami knew they messed up a bit and responded by improving the game play and character selection on the future TMNT titles plus targeting them more for kids because kids were the large fanbase of TMNT.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Difficult, but fun!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1196467200, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2007"}

It came to Nintendo's virtual console, so I decided why not download it for a change?  After all, in the late 80's early 90's I really enjoyed this game.  It was really something to have.  Years later it's apparent of two things: The game was horribly designed, and it CAN'T stand the test of time.  The fact that on Nintendo's VC it's also a dollar more than the other NES games is also questioning.  It's hard to make a game this bad.If you were a fan of the Turtles a long time ago back in the early 90's the first thing you'll notice about the game is that it hardly has anything to do with the show at all outside of some of the major characters.  Outside of that there are no foot soldiers, and most of the enemies you encounter you never saw in the show in the first place.  You will come across Bebop and Rocksteady but none of the other enemies were actually ever in the show in the first place.  Kind of daunting.What really makes the game horrible, however, lies within the gameplay.  Firstly, the turtles themselves are unbalanced and put to unfair use.  You can switch between any of the turtles at a time, but for the most part, only one of them is of any use to getting you through the adventure.  Michaelangelo and Raphael are completely useless, as their weapons lack to the range to actually do anything.  Leonardo is alright, but Donatello is the only real useful one here, as he's the only one who can attack downward and at a range.  More than likely you'll only want to use the other three to sacrifice so that Donatello can do some beating up on enemies.The way the levels are designed is also horrendous.  You basically walk around an overworld map and go into sewers, warehouses and whatnot.  The problem is that you never know where to go next.  This non-linear style wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many blasted dead ends.  To make the experience even more grueling, the game is just FULL of enemies that will respawn almost the second you turn around.  You could go through a tough warehouse fighting tons of tough enemies, only to find you can't go any further.  So now you'll have to backtrack and you may have to fight all those enemies again.  So if you don't lose a turtle getting to a dead end, you'll probably lose him getting from it.The game isn't really difficult, it's just unfair and frustrating.  The fact that two of your four players are completely useless tells you something.  The later turtles games were far better than this.  Skip the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.  It's so unfair that the experience is frustrating.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II and III were far better, and there's still no turtles game that beats the all time best: Turtles IV: Turtles in Time.  If you need a classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fix, the first Turtles game on the NES isn't going to do it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "A Horribly Designed Game", "unixReviewTime": 1176422400, "reviewTime": "04 13, 2007"}

I figured trying the game again 15 years later with more improved game skills and a walkthrough just MIGHT enable me to beat it.  Now I'm thinking there's just no way.  I've beaten the original Super Mario Brothers, Pilotwings, Zelda 2, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out, Jurassic Park on SNES, and other extremely challenging games, but this one is just too much.Still, I'm not all that disappointed.  I mean, I'm able to get through level 2 at almost any time now, and I actually made it all the way to level 4.  So at least I can do better now than I did 15 years ago, and that's why I bought the game.  To see how far I've come.But I'm not going to make it all the way to finishing the game.  It's too difficult.  There is NO room for error.  None.  I've never seen a game where you had to be so accurate with your jumps.  I mean you have to actually watch how hard you press the button.  If you just barely tap it too hard or too soft, you'll miss your jump.  Also, you can't be too far on or off the platform you're jumping from.  You've got to press the button at JUST the right second and with JUST the right amount of force as you walk off the platform.  And when you miss a jump, you have to fight a whole swarm of enemies you just killed yet another time before you get a chance to try the jump again.  This wouldn't be so bad if there were a way to actually master jumping in this game.  But there's not.  You could try the same jump 3,000 times, and after all that, you'd still be very likely to miss your next attempt, even after all that practice.For the past few days, I kept getting further and further along in the game every time I played, but I think I've finally had enough.  I reached this part where spiked walls come at me, and all I have to do is drop down holes to avoid them.  But I lost ALL FOUR of my turtles to those spikes.  If the spikes touch you once you're dead.  And the holes to drop down are way too easy to walk over because you have to be so darn accurate with how much force you use to tap the control pad.  Of course, the spikes move fast enough so that if your timing isn't freakin perfect, you're dead.  If you walk over a hole by accident, forget it, the spikes are going to get you.  And if you try to be careful so you don't walk over the holes, you won't move fast enough to drop down in time, and you'll die anyway.  The lack of room for error is just so frustrating, and its present at so many points in the game.  You just get sick of trying to beat it.And just because I can beat the water level now doesn't mean I can't complain about it.  I mean shoot, even when you're WAY far away from the instant death seaweed, the stuff pulls you down like a magnet.  And if you try to swim off the top of the screen to deactivate a bomb above, you're pulled down before you reach the top.  This drains a whole lot of the miniscule time you have to complete the level.  If you waste even 10 seconds fighting this kind of magnetic effect, you've lost so much time that you'll have to just swim through all the dangerous stuff in the level and take loads of damage in order to beat the time limit.  Again, the slightest error is completely devestating.It's easier to get a PHD in quantum physics than it is to beat this game.  Gosh, it's depressing.  But it has some great graphics and sound at least.(Update - 7/14/07  Okay, I actually, by some miracle, got all the way to the inside of the technodrome; after getting through all the random BS where you have to hunt for it.

I never could land the freaking plane!Impossible.I got this game back in the mid 1980s when it came out.  I hated it.  Namely because I never could land the damn plane on the freaking aircraft carrier.For a mid 1980s game, it's a fairly decent, if boring, flight simulator.  But don't think you'll be getting a real flight simulator.  You just chose your plane, then you you fly in this big boring blue frame for a while, and try to dodge missles.  There's no real music.  That's the whole game.  There are four missions, but I only got to the third mission.  There's a good reason for that.But what makes this game so notorious for those who remember it (my generation, basically), is landing the plane on the aircraft carrier.  When you land the plane, you get a long approach, in which the game will continually tell you to press up or down on the control pad, to made sure you are aligned properly.  And no matter how meticulously you follow the instructions, YOU ALMOST ALWAYS CRASH.  I can remember being a little kid and getting so frustrated at this game because I could never land.  My brother landed once or twice, but that's about it.The other bad part is, I think in mission 3, you have to fuel midair when a big fuel plane comes up on top of you.  Just like landing, you have to press up or down to make sure the cable that will transport the gas from the fuel plane to your aircraft is properly aligned.  Just like the landing on the aircraft, you can never make the connection.  If the connection is not made, then the fuel aircraft will break the connection, leaving you to certain death as you will run out of fuel  before you reach the aircraft carrier, which you won't be able to land on anyway.The reason why I could never get past mission three is, if I remember correctly, you have three lives.  You lose the first two lives on the first two missions because you can't land, then you lose your life because you can't fuel.  I think the fourth mission has to do with a space shuttle, but I never knew any of my friends who had the game to get to that level.Just a really bad game.  Google Angry Video Game Nerd's review of it, he is, as usual, spot on (beware, he has a lot of adult language to the point his reviews are borderline obscene, but still funny as hell).Oh, also, this game has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE.

Kick, and Punch, hold down both buttons and do a body slam.Each guy has a custom move like Bam Bam Bigelow doing his cartwheel. You can climb the bottom turnbuckles and jump off them. That's about it. Unfortunately, body slams don't play too much into this game. Get down the moves and see if you can beat the tournament.

There's even something nice to be said about having adjustable rapid fire buttons that you toggle on and off and literally dial in for the right spray of shots.The \"slow motion\" mode is a little hokey, though. It simply simulates it by rapidly toggling the \"start\" button used for pausing.

One of the games didn't stand out much for the fact that not very many copies were sold, but it quickly rose to become a cult classic.  It was among the first of its kind and generated sequels and spin-offs that would please many gamers around the world.  His name: Mega Man.THE GOODThe graphics were ahead of their time and this is one of the few instances where an early game reaches the potential of the system.  The music was also very well written and many of the tunes stood out including Cutman, Elecman, and Fireman.  This was one of the first games to define the \"platform\" genre (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was around the same time as well).  Of course, it's fun.  I noticed many Mega Man gamers tend to dismiss this one because \"it was raw\" and/or \"it was too hard.\"  Bah.  I enjoyed the difficulty level and I like this game over Mega Mans 5-8 anyhow (not that they were terrible, mind you).  The ending was also pretty good considering no dialogue is spoken.THE BADIn this game, when you're flashing and you hit spikes, you still die.  This was changed in later entries.  Also, there is no password system to save your game, so you'd have to start from scratch every time.  Oh, and did you remember the game box's cover?  Weird.  Still, this is Mega Man in its raw form and should be reviewed lightly.OVERALLWhat can I say?  The Mega Man series is a great one and this is the one that started the whole thing.  I loved the old school feeling this game has and the fact that it's among the hardest in the series.  This is a hidden gem, folks; it's rare, but I highly suggest you hunting down this game for your NES.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The first in an incredible video game series", "unixReviewTime": 1058140800, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2003"}

The game unfortunately feels lacking in several areas compared to MM2, 3, 4 and 5.  The backgrounds are a little boring and repetitive, the gameplay feels slower than what you've come to expect later on and maybe even choppy at times, the amount of enemies are few and far between, and the music is probably not up to par either.  However I believe it's completely forgiveable for a debut to have these problems, especially since it's Mega Man we're talking about here- the action-packed series that satisfied most of our heart-pumping explosion cravings in the 80's and early 90's.  We also need to realize this game was probably a major influence for all the robotic-themed video game series released several years later.  I can't say this with absolute certainty- only knowing this game was highly praised back in the day allows me to assume it was influential to some extent.Yes, you only have 6 bosses and stages compared to what would quickly become the standard (8), but these stages offer a wonderful challenge and gameplay basically the same as Mega Man 2.  To give an example of the games difficulty, these flippable platforms appear early on in one stage that will SURELY force you to lose in controller-slamming fashion until you figure out how they function.  Losing is quite alright though- this game is part of the rough and tough \"expect no mercy\" gaming experience from the mid to late 80's.  This period of gaming is exactly what made the NES so awesome.  It wasn't really about completing the game for many of us- it was about how far we'd be able to progress.This game also uses a points system which seems really odd but again, Capcom didn't know at the time that a point system wasn't really necessary so I can't fault it- only ignore it.  Great start.  Please though, make sure you enter these stages with the correct weapon or you probably won't survive.  Why is this, you wonder?  Because the enemies take away a pretty good amount of damage per hit.  For those who don't like this game, please consider that it could have been a lot worse.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "mega action", "unixReviewTime": 1354579200, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2012"}

They got their start during the 1980's making video games for the NES. In 1987, they released several of them in hopes of showing that their games were fun to play. Little did they knew that a major franchise was born to humble beginnings; Mega Man almost didn't see the light of day outside of Japan. Capcom decided at the last minute to release it in the U.S. and it led to one of the worst box art designs in the history of video games. It didn't matter because the few players who got their hands on this game realized that there was something cool about it. Word of mouth quickly spread out through the gaming community and Mega Man had gathered a cult following. Oh yes....the Blue Bomber's first adventure left quite an impression on gamers everywhere.In Mega Man, you control Mega Man (AKA Rockman in Japan), a human-like robot created by Dr. Wright (later on, Capcom changed his name to Dr. Light.) He sought out the game's main villain, Dr. Wily, who re-programmed Dr. Wright's robots to work for him and wreck havoc in the city of Monsteropolis. As Mega Man, you chose from six stages filled with enemies, traps, pits and a Robot Master. Beat the Robot Master of each stage to acquire his special power. After you clear all six stages, you ran through four more stages filled with more boss characters, the chance to fight all six Robot Masters again and finally, you fought against Dr. Wily. You did not have access to passwords or battery backed saves but you were able to pick up extra lives and had unlimited continues.The PROS: Out of all the games Capcom released, this one stuck out. It was a one of a kind game involving robots, a futuristic setting, the ability to gain enemy robots' powers and interesting stage layouts that put your shooting, jumping and memorization skills to the test. For its time, the graphics were pretty sharp and bright. The sound effects and controls were spot on and easy to appreciate. The music was excellent since each Robot Master's stage got its own theme so it fit the mood perfectly. There was a lot of variety when it came to enemy robots and some were exclusive to certain stages. Mega Man quickly became known as a hard as nails game to play through so if you beat it, you were among an elite group of gamers that managed to pull it off.The CONS: Since it was really hard to beat back then, it also proved to be its biggest fault. At the time, most games were pretty easy to clear compared to Mega Man. The game had been too much for some players which led to most people who attempted to beat it to give up completely. It was a bit demanding to beat the game in one setting even though you had unlimited continues and enemies would randomly drop extra lives though not as often. It was also one of the few games where you didn't earn extra lives through points so it didn't help at all.Despite the steep learning curve and the fact that it demanded high gaming skills, Mega Man earned its place in video game history and gave birth to one of Capcom's most recognized video game characters. They would go on to release five more sequels on the NES, a new spin off series for the SNES and PS1 and multiple portable iterations. If you missed your chance to play this diamond in the rough title, you can search for a used copy or pick up the Mega Man Anniversary Collection for the PS2 or Gamecube consoles. Also, if you own a Wii, you can download this game from their Virtual Console Service for US $5.00 (500 points.)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Blue Bomber's first adventure", "unixReviewTime": 1318809600, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2011"}

Some parts are a little bit stressful, but it's not a hard game at all. I must say though that the levels MUST be done in a specific order. Look it up online.

It will take about 14 hits to take out cut man if you due not use his weakness bomb man ability and for cut man you can take him out with only two hits throw the two boulder atr him each one should take away half his vital if he does not dodge them he also may  have a second weakness against fire man but it maye not be as effective and may take more hits. Guts man it takes about 21 hit to to defeat this or any robot master if you don't fight the master with his his weakness first which is bomb manFor guts manCut man can be defeated with two hits of a boulderActually if you have this one game cube and are very lasy enough they actually have a cheat  on the action replay for megamans I belive 1-4 that automatically starts you off at the doctor willy stages which are ridiculous short in the first game compared to it's 7 proccessors.I will now list a total estimate endurnace for the remain bosses because it varies depending on the order the fought them the first time if you now which ability does the most damage. They had two cartoon series for this but both have been of the air for a while the megaman battle network cartoon shown megaman NT warrior was discontinue back in middle of 2004 or 2003 I belive due to lack of interest or something like that.Here is the estimated esitance strength for all boss starting at electric man the first time and there weakness.Boss 3Eletric man  has 1/3 resitance against cut mans ability.Boss 4Ice man has 1/3 resitance against electirc mans electric blast ability.Boss 5Fire man ironically has  1/5 resitnace to ice mans ability I guess it makes since because it frozen water ignore the pokemon rulesBoss 6Bomb man  is apparently weak against fire mans ability  he only has a 1/7 resitance against it which makes him the toughest boss in the game some far endurance wise excluding doctor willy if you use the proper weakness re use these same powers at the end when you refight the robot master.Megaman triva factThis game only has 6 but starting in number two there were eight robot master per game after the second installement on. The last two games  where done on either on Sega Gensis, or one  of the other two sega system  because nes had been stopped make them in nes format after number six do to a lose of interest and a demand for better computer graphics or something like that. There was a cartoon series based off this did very well in season one and two but did very poorly in final season the one episode they did they acting or something was so bad that after that one episode for the third season the so was discontinue. They have two dvds sets of this cartoon show for sale that are about three disk each have about maybe 2 hours of episode on each disk. I rented one of them from blockbuster a long time ago I austin when they were still half VHS back in the middle of 2003 or earlt 2004 I belive it was. I only watched it once because of the long running time the late fee policy had not been abolished yet I remember correctly.Wily stage bossesThe original yellow devil made out of clay not the slime version from number Mega Man 7 or Megman 8.  7  elctric mans ability shot in the eye will take it out. It only has one attack be glade this was before power figther games came out in Japan when it could turned into a sphere shape and shot laser at you and split up into three devils and regain some of its health when the convere back into one depending one which game you were playing.A single mega man holgram not three like in megaman 2 or 3 and the games  after them.This boss does not have a precise weakness will minc you use what ever power you use against you the real megaman this player took him out with 14 of fire man hits will doging some of  holligram megaman fire man like sonic boom shaped attacks.You also have to fight all the main robot master over but I think he cheats a little he takes cut man out with 10 single shot attacks I belive it's supposed two take 15 to 21 single shot to defeat a robot  master or special boss  or at least that main in the other games I have played.The one eyed robot with the bubble shield around it can be defeated by combine rapid fire which guts mans ability about 14 hits maye more or less of the two cobine will take it out.Doctor willy fightYou only fight will once in this gameTakes about sixteen total hits from fire man and cut man combined that what this player did For the first half use first man then switch to cut man the second half when you hit the gem in the center which is hard but possible the fire attacks are only about half as effective as the cut man attacks are.I will do facts and statics for mega man X and Megaman three later in about a 1 hour twenty minutes or around 11:30 AM.This was a smash hit back in the mid eigites when it came out. this is done with out the cheats on Here are some tips on how to beat this game on Megaman collection in gamecube format with cheats. Put in your actionb replay and put on all the codes except the one that automatically takes you to doctor willy stages. It took me about  30 to 2 hours to beat this due to  a few occasional deaths due to miss time jumps and falling in the voids areas with the fly megaman cheats and accidentall touch spikes a few  times by hover up to high and fast. Doctot will has a strong combine resistance  from both parts of the fight of about 30 to 50 if all six robot master abilitys and your normal blaster shout are used depending on the combination you used them in. To lower willy rsitance in the second part of the final battle avoid using ice mans and bomb mans and gut's mans ability since the saucer defense strength is to strong against them and there are no bricks for you to pick up and throw. So I recommend you use a combination of normal shoot combination electric man, cut man, and flame mans attack to cut the resitance damge  to about 1/10 to 2/3  the percent estimate of above. I will be send the boss data for all the other megaman games on here except legends and mega X I am currently checking for a megaman 2 speed run I now there is one for seven or 8. I found a speed run but it was for the japanese version here is and estimated of the total boss damge resitance  for the japanese. The 22 bosses include the robot master remathc had about a combine total  damage resitance of 173% due to a differcne in weakness and more frequent uses of the weaker and less sucesfull normal shout and rapid shooit abilities and the glitche such as beinng able to walk through walks and sometimes move at faster speed which were taking out of the us edited version.  If you want to beat this gamer in about 26 in the american format other than practice doging and time alot use the weaknes  listed on the megaman main web page under the hints for megaman. I copy the exact weaknes s but can't paste then. Got go my room called I got to ghome and pick up a relation ship quiz and do some alst minute cleaning up the apartment.  I have use on thing to say hey Willy Say Heloo to  robotic friend!  Here are the mega man three boss statis for total combine damage resitance of proton man and magnet the first time have a combine damge resistance of about 28% against the rapid fire attack that mena s each indivudalseperate shoot fire in chain of three takes away about 3.7% of the max damage. After Mega man three in the middle of Megman 4 or 5 near the final. Protoman who was aparetnylu had substained some damage while he was being created before rock anhd roll our porject the doctor against willy and temperaly went out of control willy used him he eventually got repaired and freed profffesor casrtocks daugter and the end of megaman 4 and 5  she appaears after you deplete  cause version of saucer health bar. You do fight protoman against some time inbetween 6 and 8 but it's a special secret boss battle that only occurs if you do certaain tasks in specified booss strength he is blastically test your up graded system since you got the more powerful mega buster that comes out in the middle of megaman 3 or four when willy Robot's attack stamina size and speed and endurance increases if you don'ty have there weakeness.  Here is the new boss weakness for next protman fight he has a damage resitance of 24% or the equivlent of 8 mulit shoot rapid fire attacks which shoot out three bullets at a time compared to one single  and does double to triple the damagae since Protman does not have and e4xact weakness this is the best techinque for counter him.  Doged a t least ten percent of his blast and the next robot master or more you should making it trhow this leavel with health. Higly Recommend getting this on the megaman anniversayry with the new features like automatic save after the defeat of ever robot master or some sub bosses to make it less complicated.  Here is the quicvk way to defeat Hard many he ha 1/7 defense resitance some magnet mans ability does a masive amount of damage about 14 to 15 percet damge each time  it hits. Heres how to defeat top man with eassy mail him with three of hard mands projectile fist attack and he is gone for now until the finally of the game.  For shadow many four hits of top mans attack will do him in. He goes down. I'm afraid I'm  afraid your going to have to wait unti some time tommorow between 7 am 4:00 PM to get the rest of the boss statisic because the staff member at the program does not think this is a wise use of study hall. He wants me to bring my realtions ships book her when the next test isn't probably for anothe like 15 days or something like that the topic I consider controversal. I see you tommorow gamers. Unless the staff member goes off due before this study hall ends around 8:00 PM. Go foward and defeat evil may the buster be wity you. I am back sorry about the delay here is the quickest way to beat spark man next to using the drain health with X button cheat if play the Gamecube format with cheats on. Spark Man has and extremly low damage rsitance strength of 1/7 orr lose about 14 percent of his health each time he is hit with shadow man's weapon ability. Hit him seven times and he goes down. The same startegy for the main robot masters I am listting now will probably also work again at the finally when you rechallange them again at the end of the game. The next guy beats snake man with shadow many weapons which it has a  super high damge resitance at 1/15 mean each blade that hits only does about little more than  6 percent damge per hit 6.6 per5cent about if you want to be that precise. But I think he could have taken down sooner I'm not sure if this player used the right weakness. I am fast foward through the  bits ofg normal enemy fights this to get this complete sonner. I belive when the games started get even longer than in the first two installments longer that pluse. I think is when they have additional extra robot master in this game before willy called Doc Robot or he is Megman 4 5 or 6 you have to fight him twice in four stage he use the powers and the forms of previous robot masters from previous game.  The next boss is Gemi man who;s weakness I know from watching my roomate at my last college program play this game at leats thrice pluse. If this kid use the right weakness mhe should defeat him quickly.  I have the status  I ma compele of minutes. I think this player just skip a protman boss fight somehow. Thi s player was experiend he used gemini mans ultra weakness. Gemmin man has a resitance  damge strenght of only 1/5 to the search snake hit him with five  of snake mans attack at 20% damage each he is gone until the final.  To victor goes the supplies or his power to me more precise. It time for the final boss fight with a robot master from this man needle man I belive his summer weakness is the gemini laser from playing this at least three times and watching my roomate play it I am 95% positive.  This guy took him down with three hits. I don't think he used Gemin man I belive he used needle mans or weakness top man. Top many is super deaddly he ahs a mear 1/3 damage so three hits of 33% will take hin down for know I belive gemi laser has about the same damage sligtly weaker. I think I don't got top man's weakness. But I don't know both of top mans weakness  which I some how neglected to record. But top man is very unusally. He has a super low resitance to his own ability three blows from his own attack will do him in but use shadow  mna or gemi or the rapid fire if your with out a cheat on thatr automatically gives you all the weapons for the first bat5tle. Next I belive are the mfour annoying doc robot stages where you must fight him two0 times per stage. Yes I was right this is the one game that this annoying master known as doc man is. Here are the doc robot stsatics. For the first doc robot fight if you are due the  stages in this order his super weakness for the first battle is magnet mans attack which he has 1/8 resitance agin. That means each time you hit you do a massive 12 to 14damage each set of 2 to four magnets.  Eight hits he he goes down its on to the second battle for this stage statics.  The next boss fight will be quick man or are replica of him hit him with 7 snake man abilities these will do slight more damge about about 13 to 15 percent damge per hit and he goes down. The next fight wight doct robot with bubble man inside 7 hits of about 13 to 15 percent damage if you I belive the shadow man weapon will mtake him down he was attack really fast but I belive that was what he was using.  Hit him with 9  of needle mans three projectiles acts and he goes down. PS he is using wood man who has the same annoying barrier ability of plan man and skull man. So wait until a break min the leaf bare then fire out it will  do now damge when it connects. For doc man with flame inside hit him with dust mans attack but expect to lose 98% of your health due to the super close range that is need  for this attack to work successfull. If you have a e try to use it to avoid dying especially if its the original nes version. For the next doc mans stage with air man has 1/9 damage resitance hit it with 9 attacks from spark man's ability and it goes.  For crash mh and doct robot he has 1/4 resitance against fglash man hit him four time quickly and he goes down with out you die or minal damage to your health bar. Know we have one really annoying battle before the willy and robot master refight and the other willy  stage break man.  High hit with about eight rapid fire attacks and he retreat then. You will learn about dark willy betrayal in a cut scene. To beat the hover robot in the water filled room hit his turtle minions and destroy them shade mans does the most damge per turtel opr set of turtle s robots destroyed repeat this attack pattern 5 times this boss goes down. To the next stage you are reunited with a famous boss for megaman 1. The giant  yellow cylopse monster now as the yellow devil for this newer slight better still clay version hit it in the eight with 7 of hard mans attacks and it goes down. Next stage I have and appoint in 35 minutes I will make the rest of this really speedy. The next boss I hologram megam one willt take damge. This kid found it took out is hole health bar with one seacrh snake I dont think that I possible the two hit kills were supposed to go away after number 2 I thought well. Any way use snake man on the holgrams detrmine which one takes damage and take it out they will switch places beteen the free platform areas. Were donwn to the final 10 fights ten eighr robot master and the two will fight with and with out game and only nine minutes left will credits. So I will give you a total resitance because these enemies are going to go down at light speed. the remain totals boss including willy should have total combine damage resitance should be defeated with a total of 75 hits. The end seqeunces  play basically the roof collapse on you and you wake up back at doctor lights lab your here a wistle and doctor light assume protoman megaman protype or brother as he is refered to in the cartoon series. You have just defeated megaman three.  If you curse if while alwqays gets away he is eventually captured at the end of megaman 6 this is a spiler so do read this if you haven't played the games after this but escape because he had built eight other robots  a few games prior to this that were designed to seek out while if they were not activated or senses his presence after a six month period. Congralutaion you just beat the third installment of megaman if you followed these tips. Now go foward and fight evil. I will send megaman four statics next or what ever game I can find in the series that I have not laready posted boss statics for yet. I aready have statics four megam X- 3 and megamn 7 and 8 and megaman legend I can find a speed run of for. So I have to do my own at home and type of the data because I don't have a youtube acoount or and emulator program on my labtop and the internet is being real slow to reconnect due to being tampered with. So I will start megaman 4 speed run at home which I will type up the status and bring them in and type them in by hand later. They have and X speed run but I am supposed to have a meeting with my mentor Christian which she is about ten minutes over due either she doesn't know I'm in here or the schedule changed. My normal indepedent slash lunch slash indepdent study time  I have been doing this megaman three speed run and erase  JPEG of the computer to save menmory during instead because appointments go change. Which means next apoinment or appoints that I would have had in between 1 and 4 when my afternoon meeting is called then I am stuck out of the building for the rest of the eight hour period of today due now study hall. I got to try to find my menitor I'll send you the megaman four statics from home later today if the iternet has recieved all the sent data from before it got connected that failed to go through. I'll see you later mega buster HOA! The first boss fight you can't win you can't destroy vel the first time after a certain amounts  of hits. A cut scene will occur and Zero will appear will fire his mega buster like weapon take of one of the original Viles arms before he got update to look more like Jango feet in Megman X 3. For the chilling Penguin  use your mega buster from a distance and dodge as much as possible.I think about seven max power hit if you don't shot him when he is isinvulerable like when slides across the floor our us his ice scultpture attack or spiting his ice ball projectiles from his mouth and when he is standing in a certain position will bring him down. This person had to him him will 11 charged shoot a couple of times he fired at the wrong time like when the pnenguin was standing in a poisition or dogging at which he is invulerable when performed even if they shot hits. He will flash if I hits correctly so will the other bhosses.  I don't know what his master weakness in the super nes game or the reformated Plastation 2 and gamecube version. But on Megman extreme 1 it is the flame stags ability but that because  the boss differ on extreme depending on the difficult setting there not all from X one some like the stage are from the second game and later stage is only one medium or extreme mode.  This player defeat the storm eagle using 8 charge shoot and a few multi shots. The next boss is the flame mamoth this maverick is supposed to be so massive his whole body doesn't appear on the screen. For the mamoth who is not a big as I thought the quickest way to defat hit him with about 6 of storm eagles attacks and  cyber dumbo goes down.  The next boss this guy did is the Spark Mandrill.  For the mid way boss the blow fish slash land mine 5 hits will take it down of the storm eagles attack. 8 of the chilling penguins attack will take this over grown cross of  shocker and king kong out.  Next boss is the armored Armadillo I think his weakness may be spark mandrills power.  It is a weakness not as effective as the ice on the Mandrill but elevn hits from the spark mandril will fry this over wrecking ball.  Next boss is the launch octopus.  It has an eleven percent resitance to the bubble attack this boss has fast speed so you need to attack equalty fast to avoid a kill I playing with out cheats or auto save avilable.  The kid next does the bommer hanger.  If I remember correctlt chamleon is weak against this bosses ability so you might want to due it next if your going in this order.  11 of the octupus bosses attack will defeat this boss who also has high attack speed and strength.  Next boss this person challenges is the Sting Chamelon. I was correct ten hits from the boomer rang will bring down this giant reptile. Due it fast enough he won't even be able to use his cloacking ability.  Now the last half of the Game is the sigms stage Sigma is the equivalent to Dcotor willy for the Megaman X series the main bad robot. It's time fight Vile again but this time zero is behind and electric containment tube this time. After  four shot zero break free the second half of the battle once  Vile mogure like battle robot is destroyed begins  and all health lost is restored. Hit him about 7 more time if you are using the right weakness for a total damage resitance of about 12% then proceed on to the end of the stage this might actually be a midway boss.  You have to fight bommering guy again I don't now why they didn't save this for the warp tubes before sigma. But use the missle attack again  he should go done with about the same amount of hits maybe a few more. The next boss is the spider its weak spot is the smal jewel on it back this another one of those boss with high attack speed but low defense  if you counter fast enough before she pulls up out of  firing range.  I only have and hour  ten minutes and my next free time period is only about and hour so  not until around 3;00 PM unless med check get out super early like 25 minutes. I am going to be fastfoward a lot through this.  Next you have to fight the chilling penguin again 11 fire beam attack if launched when he is not on in and invulerable position and Cilly Will 3000 goes down again. Next you fight the hawk again I believe this is the finally before the sigma battles. His attack weakness is a laser  multi shot weapon the chamelons about 7 to 12 hits he goes down.  Use the same laser ability for the robot in the room with the spikes.  Fight the armadilo again use the same ability again from the previous fight. Next is the Chamelon rematch fight use the boommer attack again like the last time. The chilly penguin again for the second fight with the monkey maverick boss. The same weapons also for the octupus the elephant, For next new boss use the booomer like on the chamelon 11 times to take it down. For Sigma dog use the same  attack you used on the monkey eight times or the ice attack.

It's needless to say that every video game series has to start somewhere. For Mega Man, the beginning was in December of 1987 on the Nintendo Entertainment System. As easy as it is for one to slap down a date and call it a starting point, when did Mega Man become a household name, when did it really take off? Look no further than Mega Man II and Mega Man III.Why am talking about the immediate sequels when it's the original that's on the table here? When dissecting a game, it's good to start with a dose of reality. Most people (Capcom included) would probably have a hard time saying that the original Mega Man was a complete success. In fact, the creation of the superior Mega Man II was considered a \"rogue effort\" by the developers involved, a project that was far from being on the front burner. So in going from one game that almost never had a sequel to a game that now has nine, where does the original Mega Man fit in beyond being a point of origin?To get to the bottom of that question, one has to at least focus on the first three games. As odd as this may sound in this day and age, Mega Man's initial adventure was undoubtedly unique. I'm not talking about things like having six bosses instead of the standard eight or the lack of energy tanks, but the impersonal, industrial feel the stages. Other elements, like gun turret traps, the drab color palette, uneven difficulty and lack of support characters fueled the feeling that you were truly alone, that you were charged with terminating six humanoid robots with little to no explanation. All you knew was that they had to be destroyed.This begs the question: what is the original Mega Man known for? It's collection of robot masters? It's insane crash damage when fighting the Yellow Devil? It's somewhat peculiar and forgettable level design? These are all good answers, but it's only one them - the game's cast of robot masters - that are truly memorable. Obviously, the game's music goes hand and hand with this, but beyond these simplistic yet loveable characters there's nothing here the sequels don't or can't do better.This is why the original Mega Man is for the true-blue Mega Man fan only; casual fans can get by without or have a more engrossing time with one of its sleeker and much more welcoming successors like Mega Man 2 or 6.

Part one of a nine game series.For the most part, NES action platform games were very entertaining, but often they lacked variety and ways to reward the player. Most games (with the exception of RPG and Adventure games) had you play as a character who is more or less the same at the end as they were when you started. In 1987, Capcom stepped in and came up with an interesting idea: \"What if you could defeat a boss and steal their weapon to use for the rest of the game?\" Thus, the Mega Man series was born. Here's the lowdown on the first legendary game:PROS:-While the story isn't exactly incredible, this being the first game, it is actually pulled off well. Two scientists, Dr. Light and Dr. Wily, created six mining robots which specialized in specific environments. However, Dr. Wily became jealous of Dr. Light's praise and so he reprogrammed these six robots to do his own evil bidding. Secretly, Dr. Light had created two household robots, Rock and Roll. Rock decides to have Dr. Light fit him with armor and a plasma gun in order to stop Dr. Wily and the six corrupted Mining bots, thus turning Rock into Mega Man.-Even though there are only six bosses, they are each very unique and offer a variety of weapons. For instance, Cutman throws his scissors out in a boomerang-like fashion, while Gutsman picks up boulders and hurls them. Also, THE BOSSES ARE NICE AND TOUGH. Elecman is particularly nasty.-Mega Man's controls are nice and simple. He may not have a lot of abilities in this game, but the \"jump/run/shoot\" set of controls are all he really needs here.-POSSIBLY THE MOST DIFFICULT ENTRY IN THE SERIES. Yes, this game will really test your gaming abilities to the limit, as there are no E-tanks and passwords to be found here. I seem to notice that a lot of people complain about the lack of passwords. Please. Mega Man games are generally pretty short, so IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE TO SIT THROUGH AN ENTIRE MEGA MAN GAME, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER PLAYING THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. I never use passwords.-GREAT VARIETY OF LEVEL DESIGNS AND ENEMIES TO FIGHT. The levels aren't too terribly long, but not brief either. Likewise, the enemies will definitely keep the player busy enough to make it challenging, but not too frustrating (except for maybe the final levels).-The graphics are nice for the era, and there is very little if any slowdown present. The sprites of Mega Man and the bosses are all equal size, not like later entries in which the bosses dwarf the poor blue guy.-This might be cheating, but I LIKE THE PAUSE CHEAT THAT YOU CAN USE TO HELP YOU WITH SOME BOSSES. I won't tell you how to use it. Find out yourselves.-Though the sound effects are good, IT'S THE MUSIC THAT WILL REALLY CATCH YOUR ATTENTION. Most of the tunes are done well, my favorites being Iceman and Elecman's themes in particular.There are no bad tunes to be found here.CONS:-Even though this is the first game, I THOUGHT THAT THE MAGNET BEAM GENERATOR ABILITY WAS LACKING. Whenever you're standing on one and it disappears, you not only fall, but you DIVE STRAIGHT DOWN AS FAST AS A BULLET! It's the only extra ability besides the boss weapons, and it seemed like a good idea, but not quite there in its execution.-THERE ARE NO E-TANKS YET. This isn't that big of a deal because this makes the game more challenging, but there a few areas (the later levels in particular) in which you'll really wish you had them.-SPIKES ARE THE DEVIL IN THIS GAME!! Not because they can kill you in one hit, but because they can kill you while you're recovering from an attack. It might make traversing levels harder, but I find this to be annoying. Thankfully, Capcom fixed this in the next game.-Though the main character is in fact Mega Man, by looking at the box cover, you'd think otherwise.-What's up with the point system? You go around collecting little orange and red balls throughout the levels which are supposed to increase your score at the end of each level, but THE POINTS NEVER EARN YOU LIVES OR ANYTHING. Thankfully, this is the only game to include points.Overall, this is a great game even though there are a few rough spots here and there. Besides, it laid the official groundwork for the rest of the series, and EVERYONE HAS TO AT LEAST APPRECIATE THAT. It's not my favorite MM game, but it is certainly not bad at all. In fact, this was the last of the NES MM games I played. 4 stars overall. If you want a game which has a great old-school feel, but will not let you down on the challenge factor, then the first MM game is the right place to come to.

{"reviewerID": "A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR", "asin": "B00004SVXG", "reviewerName": "Mike London \"MAC\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "When Capcom released MEGA MAN (or ROCKMAN in Japan), they could have had little idea that they just launched their biggest franchise, nor would it be possible for the buying public to realise this character would go on to become the most prolific game character ever.His first game, an action platformer from 1987, famously introduced the concept of chosing your own order in which to beat the stages.  Not only that, when you defeat the boss of that level, you get his/her powers, and can use these powers against other robot masters.  While the weaknesses had some logic in them in the first three games, as it is based off the game Paper, Rock, Scissors, the further we got along in the MM series the less that analogy really worked (seriously, why is Tomahawk Man in MM VI weak too ?).  While the game itself is pretty linear, MM still gave the players a rather remarkable sense of freedom in the 1980s.  While the concept has since been beat to death, if you're from that generation of players you can't help but appreciate MM's rather daring game play.  But that doesn't mean it's a perfect game.  Not by a long shot.The game has some of the most notorious cover art in video game history.  The cover art has absolutely nothing to do with the game, and Mega Man looks like a forty five year old man holding a gun in some bizarre futuristic place.Like most franchise that began in the 1980s (Castlevania, Metroid, Kid Icarus, Ninja Gaiden, Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and several others), this first game may seem a little bit rough compared to later installments.  While arguably SMB could be released in today's game market with little or no changes, games like Metroid, the first Zelda, and this title  would never be released without some significant revisions.  Metroid has no automap, and you're left wondering around this labyrinth maze with little or no direction where to go.  Zelda has the same issue, though instead of a maze it's a large overworld, and it's damn near impossible to find all its secrets without referring to some type of map or game guide, which in the 1980s were hard to come by if you didn't have a subscription to Nintendo Power (the essential gaming magazine of the 1980s).  Metroid is a particular favorite of mine, particularly for the lack of auto-map, but for those professional critics who criticize its game play, the original LEGEND OF ZELDA is just as unforgiving and obtuse at times.  Still both are great games.Mega Man is the same way.  There [are undeniably some great parts to the game, but it's a little rough around the edges by today's standards, like most games of that era].  Overall, the game's difficulty is rather high, especially in the last stages.  And, like Zelda II, the game difficulty also has just some plain cheap shots to it.  If it weren't for the Magnetic Beam, I would probably never get past the last half of the Ice Man's stage (which involves jumping from platform to platform, dodging shots).  You can be standing directly on the platform, in the dead center, get shot and get knocked off or fall through to your instant death.  Even with Mega Man's infamous recoil he should be knocked that far back.  Guts Man's roving platforms at the beginning of that stage are also rather notorious.Speaking of the Magnetic Beam, all six NES titles have special items that you must use to further advance in the game.  From MMII on, you would get said item after defeating a particular robot master.  In this game, however, the item is in plain view in the Elec Man stage, though you must have defeated Guts Man and use his weapon to throw away the blocks that keep Mega Man from getting the item.  You may or may not pick it up. But here's the trick.  You must have it to get past a certain area in the opening stage of Dr. Wily's castle.  The game is rather cheap like that.Other difficulties include lack of Energy Tanks as well as no password feature.  That means every time you turn on the game you must start all over.  Now, this problem has since been alleviated with the game's release on the MEGA MAN ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION. But if you're playing on an original NES, well, good luck.Back in 1987, most gamers were still going for high scores, and so MEGA MAN, the only game in the entire (massive) franchise to do so, has points and keeps score.  Anyone who gets a high score on this game I do admire, as when you run out of lives you die, and given the game's difficulty, you will end up losing your accumulated score quite often.  Still, there's no high score keeper, and you don't get anything for high points.  Overall, this feature feels much more like a relic of its time, and very much feels like the high score feature was simply tacked on to an already existing game.  The high score serves no real function, and Capcom wisely disregarded it when they made MEGA MAN II.The game also features different graphics for the health powerup and the weapon powerup.  These items graphically are the same for MM2 to MM6, but in MM1 they appear totally different.  The game also features an exclusive item to the series, a powerup called the Yashichi.  It only appears once in the last stage of the game.  Capcom used the item in other games in that same era.[Throughout the series, if Mega Man is hit by an enemy, he becomes temporarily invincible to further attacks. From Mega Man 2 on, this invincibility would even protect Mega Man if he fell onto spikes. However, in the NES version of Mega Man 1, that is not the case. While the temporary invincibility is featured in this game, it will not prevent Mega Man from perishing if he falls onto spikes. This aspect of the Mega Man 1 play mechanics contributes greatly to the game's overall difficulty.Also, for the six NES games, MM1 is the only one that makes the player fight enemies after reaching the Robot Master's lair. In the other five installments, once Mega Man reaches the Robot Master's room, Mega Man goes into a short passageway into the next room to fight that particular level's boss. There are no enemies in these passageways, and are only one screen long. However, in MM1, the corridors are longer than one screen and there are enemies to contend with when bartering passage to the Robot Masters. These corridors might have been leftovers during development, during which Capcom originally was going to release the game on the Famicom Disk System. The corridors would have been used as \"loading tunnels\", allowing the disk to be accessed and load up the boss fight without any major pauses in the action. In the end, Capcom switched to cartridges instead, but the tunnels stayed, anyway.Mega Man 1 is also the only NES Mega Man game that makes the player climb up or down once he or she reaches the inner chamber. In Elec Man's stage, the player must climb up a ladder to reach his lair; in Bomb Man's stage, the player climbs down a ladder (or falls) to reach his lair.At the end of every NES Mega Man game, the player must fight the game's Robot Masters a second time before going to the final showdown with Dr. Wily. MM1 is the only game that spreads these fights across two separate levels (Mega Man must fight Cut Man and Elec Man on Wily Stage 2, and then has to fight Bomb Man, Fire Man, Ice Man, and Guts Man on Wily Stage 4). MM1 is also one of the only two games in the Classic series (the other being Mega Man & Bass) that does not allow the player to select the order in which to fight the Robot Masters a second time. In Mega Man 2 through 6, after defeating each Robot Master the second time, a large energy pellet appears. In Mega Man 1, these do not appear, making the last stage considerably difficult.Starting with Mega Man 2, the player is shown a visual representation of Dr. Wily's castle (or, in Mega Man 4, 5, and 6; Dr. Cossack's castle, Proto Man's castle, and Mr. X's castle, respectively, with Dr Wily's castle following each). Each stage is a dot on the map, and when Mega Man beats one stage and goes to the next, this progress is shown on the map. Mega Man 1, however, does not have this feature. In the PSP remake, Mega Man Powered Up, it can be seen as the player loads one of four final levels, and is named \"Castle Wily\". Mega Man 1 is also the only game where the player selects Dr. Wily's stage and he appears like the Robot Master with the clear points listed next to him.This section in brackets drawn from Wikipedia.  I wrote these sections in that article, however.]I can proudly say that I have beaten this game, but only once.  The last stage on Dr. Wily is absolutely brutal, and the last fight with those four bosses back to back extremely hard.  Without the pause trick I don't know how people do it.  And the Yellow Devil is a nightmare as well.  Still, I beat the game (this one's harder that LOST LEVELS any day).Of all the six NES games, this has the most old-school feel to it.  Other installments to the series feel much more refined and much more polished.  This title, though, feels like it stands along the ranks of Zelda, Metroid, Ninja Gaiden, and Mario for that old-school, mid 1980s gaming goodness.Despite its difficulty, this is easily one of my favorite NES games.  The game has proven to hold up remarkably well, despite the rough edges, and it is only by tinkering with the game engine slightly (by lowering the difficulty and introducting a couple new features) that Capcom introduced the masterpieces MMII and MMIII.  But the foundation for those games was all here.Overall, this is the worst of the original Mega Man trilogy.  Still, a legendary start, and rightly so.This is my order of Mega Man NES titles from best to worst.  II and III are the best, though I give a slight edge to II because this is the game that really redefined the Mega Man formula, but III is just as good, and probably better.  IV and V are about the same as well, though neither approach the sublime quality of the first three.MEGA MAN IIMEGA MAN IIIMEGA MANMEGA MAN VMEGA MAN IVMEGA MAN VI.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Mega Man's first adventure and a pretty good game, if a little rough around the edges", "unixReviewTime": 1193788800, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2007"}

Rhodes", "helpful": [1, 3], "reviewText": "Of all the games of the NES era, Mega Man sticks out in my mind as being the hardest.  I didn't expect it to include the things that would later go into the series such as the charge shot, or Rush or anything like that, but when I first played it, I was flabbergasted by it's extreme difficulty.  As a kid I thought it was a great game.  Now that I'm older, I can look at it with a critical eye and say that it is a good game, but even for an old school gamer, Mega Man is a game that so rightfully needed the remake that it was garnered in the PSP, and was also a game that seriously needed tweaking even when it was first released in the 80's.As with all old school games of the 8-bit era, Mega Man's focus was not story.  It was gameplay.  Storlyines didn't become important until the 16-bit era.  So if you wanted to know the premise, you needed to read the instruction manual.  Of course, you probably know it without the use of the instruction booklet anyway.Mega Man's gameplay was pretty simple.  You played as the blue bomber and selected one of six robot masters to go off and face.  You went through the level and would eventually find the robot master and take them down.  Each Robot Master was weak to another Robot Masters weapon.  In the end this proved to be a staple of the Mega Man series.  Each time you defeat a boss, you get his weapon and move on.  Fantastic.The game was difficult, though.  And when I say difficult, I'm not joking.  For one, you've got no energy tanks, and the energy pellets that restore health are not dropped very often.  Also, there are no passwords so you have to complete the game in one sitting.  Bosses also did a lot of damage to you.  For a series, Mega Man got off to a great start, but as an indiviual game, the fun is actually taken away because of the difficulty (the Yellow Devil comes to mind).  You're not invulnerabe to spikes if you get hit, and there are no energy tanks.  That makes up the bulk of the difficulty.  This probably won't bother those who played the games in order, but I started with Mega Man II.  The other big thing about the difficulty was the Magnet Beam.  You'll have to grab it in order to get further in Wily's fortress, but you don't get it by traditional means.  You have to find it in a level.  This brings about another gripe with the difficulty, if you go back to a level you must fight that Robot Master AGAIN, and you might not be prepared for that.Music wise I also didn't think highly of the first Mega Man.  A lot of the music just didn't sound fantastic to begin with.  There were some good tunes (Wily's fortress, Cut Man's stage), but there were also tunes I dreaded a lot (Ice Man's stage, the Boss Fight music).  Again, though, this is the first game.  It's just getting things started.Mega Man is a good game, but the extreme difficulty might be a bit much for even your average old school gamer who's used to such difficult feats.  It's a good game, and it'll probably test your skills more than the likes of Contra.  However, I'm not the kind of gamer who is used to that.  I was able to complete Mega Man, but it's not an easy game.  But I've heard of gamers going through the whole game without getting hit once, which means the difficulty really does provide a lot of fun.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The Start of a Great Series, but with Frustration", "unixReviewTime": 1150416000, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2006"}

It became a cultural phenomenon. Usually when a game achieves an unusual amount of success you'll have a game try to copy the formula (usually failing).  Doctor Mario, on the other hand, didn't try to copy the formula put forth in Tetris.  It simply put a new spin on the puzzle genre.Dr. Mario perhaps some of the simplest gameplay of any game.  Mario stands on the sidelines and throws pills into a jar.  In the jar are different color viruses.  Red, Yellow and Blue.  The color of the virus doesn't matter.  What matters is the colors on the pill Mario throws in.  The objective is to simply match the corresponding color of the pill with the virus.  In the first level, there are just a few viruses.  The higher the level the more viruses are in the jar.You don't have to begin at level one.  You can choose what level you want to begin with.  Even then, the game doesn't end at the maximum level you can choose.  It keeps going.  Much like Tetris, there's really no end to the game.You can also choose your speed.  Medium, Low, or High.  This is really the only thing which will add difficulty to the game.  Mario not only throws pills faster, but they fall faster, depending on the speed you choose.It doesn't sound like much, but the game is addictive.  Especially when playing against someone else.  It's not as addictive as Tetris and competition becomes more based on how fast you can do certain levels rather than actual skill.  But then again, there's not much skill involved in Dr. Mario.  Which is exactly why Dr. Mario works.  The game is so simple that anyone can play it.Visually for an NES game it looks pretty basic.  Very colorful.  Although Mario has never looked better, there isn't much you can say about Dr. Mario's graphics because they're just so basic.  Even for an NES game.  So there's nothing groundbreaking even for its time.  But who cares?  The game is fun and in the NES days that was what you played for.  It's a great game and its simple.  While there's no doubt that Tetris had nothing to fear, Dr. Mario was still a fun game.If there was anything wrong with Dr. Mario it would simply be that there's no real way to build upon it.  All the future releases of the game have pretty much been the same thing over and over again, just on a different console.  This isn't necessarily bad, but it means that if you own one of the other variants, say the Gameboy, Super Nintendo (which is the best one because you get Tetris with it), or Nintendo 64, then you're all set.

She had about 40 games, all the old favorites like Zelda, but none of them caught my attention till I tried Final Fantasy.It is a rich, multi-layered game that's extremely straightforward. There are few puzzles (I hate them, so that's good), few mazes, and few trials that are overly difficult. It's a straight hack-and-slash game -- go kill things, go through this new level and kill things there, get objects, find the big bad guy and kill him too at the end. Basically, if you're persistent, you'll figure it all out. And there's none of that irritating \"ensemble cast\" design that the later FFs seem to like. As simple as the game design is, it still manages to tell a rich and involving story that actually, considering this is a Japanese game, makes sense. It took me a month or so to beat the game, and I immediately made another party and set out again at level 1, it's so good.Since then, my mother's given me her SNES too, and I think some other system that involves CDs, but I still play Final Fantasy almost exclusively and still love it.

If you don't like RPG's, Stick to your Halo's, Medal of Honors and Gran Turismo's or whatever the hip kids are playing and keep walking. Have all the non nerds left? Ok good. Lets begin.I realize reviewing Final Fantasy is redundant. Anyone who knows this title probably owns it or has fond memories of it. Otherwise, you probably played 6 or 7 first and automaticaly judged this one as being \"kinda boring\" or \"Not as good as the newer FF games\". However, if you strip away the veneer of the newer predecessors and see what you have left, you will find that this possess most or all the things that make the later games good. Take away the androdgenous metrosexual young hero boys with amnesea, Big boobed and/or doey eyed love interests, terrible J-pop love songs, stupid or sexualized furby side characters, pointless CGI cutaway scenes, you have this game here.What this does have is the bare basics.Yes you can nitpick the gameplay in certain places. Buying potions 1 at a time. The way your party can attack a single enemy, kill the target and then strike dead air instead of the next enemy. The messed up and complicated magic system. The way airships can't land anywhere but flat grass. These are minor gripes that doesn't change the fact that this was a terrific game.While we are nitpicking, let us remember some of the inovations Final Fantasy made to a genre. One big inovation it made to the whole D&D; thing is that it simplified the battle stuff and made it fun for a wider audiance. Does anyone remember Dragon Quest/Warrior? This collapsed all the sub-menu Look/Search/talk/ect; mess into one easy button, (A).The bottom of it is this, this game was inovative and fun for its time. It still holds a place deep in the hearts of those who ran with this franchise early on until the inevitable betrayal of Final Fantasy 7- present. If you have patients and enjoy a good nes title, play this. If you are graphically motived or like rehashed anime story lines, don't bother yourself.In closing, this has monster replay value in that you can pick this up and dust it off and play it, even after years have passed.

Like many other classic NES RPGs I now enjoy playing them on my cell phone using my emulator.  This game is the perfect classic RPG in many ways:Turn based system, though outdated, still has lots of room for strategy and increases the difficulty level greatly.  There is some level grinding required, but it's fun and rarely monotonous.  I also love the ability to choose your character classes.  Sometimes I like going with 2 fighters and the obligatory white and black mage, other times I use red mages, thieves, or other fun groupings.  It makes the game unique and interesting.  Try beating the game with two thieves and two red mages!  Gold is somewhat hard to come by early on, so it makes budgeting important.Some points of interest: each class levels up at exactly the same experience points.  If a character dies, then they gain no experience and can fall behind the others in levels.  There are a few points in the game where you are pretty much forced to level grind for a bit, but other parts where you can go through a few areas without having to level up.The graphics are pretty solid for the NES hardware and the music is catchy, even though it is rather computerized sounding.

I'm what you'd call a maniacal RPG freak.. not so much in the pencil and paper AD&D; sense as the turn-based console sense.. but it wasn't always that way. I think it was my elementary-school buddy Richard who first introduced me to the original Final Fantasy, addicted me to it, and made sure I stayed on the right path when FF IV came to America as the Super NES title \"Final Fantasy II.\"So, when I sat down this past month to give the old cart another go-around, it was with plenty of fond memories tucked under my arm. A lot had changed in the thirteen years since I first played this classic, but once I'd adjusted to the transition from PS2 to NES, in many ways it was like I was back in 1990 all over again.It's the premise that launched a million clones; you take control of a party of wanderers, customizing them from the very get-go. Your group can contain any combination of Fighters, Thieves, Black Belts, White, Red or Black Mages. You're given the chance to name each one of them, though in true 8-bit fashion, your writing can't go any longer than four letters per warrior. Each different class its own has unique strengths and limitations, and a good strategist will have no problem balancing things out. It's a simple system, which remains full of possibilities even today.The graphics for this title aren't as polished as the later titles in the NES collection. The bright blue backdrops of the introductory screen, as well as the status screens, are almost painful to stare at. Likewise, each battle takes place on a flat, boring black field. Your only hint as to the location of the fight comes in the form of a small, panoramic illustration that runs along the upper quarter of the screen. What we're looking at is very dated, no question, but even within the limitations of the old NES, they could still be better.While this standard gameplay system may have set the table for hundreds of games to follow, there remain dozens of major unresolved problems. This title wasn't completely ironed out by the time it was released, and often steps over the line between being challenging and downright annoying. Whenever any member of your party is the victim of a lasting status effect (poisoning and stoning are the most common), they're immediately moved to the bottom of the assault formation, where they're much less likely to take any additional damage. While this may seem like a helpful feature, its actual implementation is a major burden. If the strongest member of your party is poisoned, the weakest member of the party steps forward to fill his shoes. In effect, it does the last thing you'd ever want it to do, and if you're not paying attention it's very easy to get caught with your pants down.The musical composition employed by this first double-F is one of the all time classics. It's the stuff of legend, still used in today's newest releases. The dozens of original songs within this title perfectly fit their surroundings, and couldn't have been any more flawlessly assembled. Unfortunately, the actual performance is beyond abysmal. The screeches and roars of that old sound card have never been so irritating. After a couple hours, you'll mute the television and put in a CD, or at least turn the volume way down. My cats are scared of the television set when I'm playing this game, due to the horrible sound it emits.As with any RPG, if you'd like to get anywhere in Final Fantasy, you'll need to talk to some non-playable characters. They're sprawled generously across every town and castle, though most have nothing of value to tell your party. Almost every individual roams the overhead map with no specific destination in mind. Amusing as this may be, it quickly grows old as they meander their way directly into your path time and time again, blocking the narrow hallways and caves .... It's like they'll go out of their way to get into yours, and then.... slowwwly.... wander..... away. Even the dungeons suffer from this problem, as bats float their way around the rooms with no particular place to go.If you've heard the term \"random encounters,\" you pretty much know the big story behind Final Fantasy. Everything in the game is built around a simple formula of \"wander countryside, meet random enemy, defeat said enemy, repeat.\" Each 'chapter' of the game brings with it a whole new tier of difficult enemies to strike down. This is not a game for those unprepared to invest hours upon hours of their life to aimless wandering. If you want to survive, you'll have to do a TON of experience gathering, which basically means you'll run around the map killing stuff.Despite my numerous gripes; the horribly dated graphics, the horrific squeal of the music and the endless level-ups, there's something about this game. Something that drives you to keep coming back, to gain that extra level, to see if maybe this time you can take down that boss. It's a trend I've noticed more and more as I've started to play some of the older classics, something that's missing from the majority of today's polished row of hip titles. Though the visuals and the audibles may be nowhere close to what we can get with today's advanced processors, there's an innocence that's rarely matched. There's a reason Chess and Checkers have been played for centuries without modification, and that same reasoning applies here to Final Fantasy I.Once you've picked this game up, you won't want to put it down until you're through.

I first heard of Final Fantasy in one of those books. Upon being pursuaded I decided to try my hand at a new side of video gaming--RPG's. Unlike the Zelda games, the graphics were SHARP and BRIGHT. Not the stupid pastel-colors in earlier NES games. When you first pop the game in, the blue narrative screen comes up and the Final Fantasy Prelude plays. But where's the title, you ask? I'll explain later. Then you name your four characters, and the best part is that you can choose which TYPES of characters you want EVERY time you start again! Do you want muscle, or magic?

After this, the fantasy begins . . . .The princess has been kidnapped by the evil knight Garland, who lives far to the north on this tiny island continent.

But the title screen STILL hasn't appeared yet. Back at your home castle, the king and queen are so happy that you saved the princess that they agree to build a bridge spanning over to the other continent. You step onto the bridge . . . and THAT'S when the title screen appears, when the Final Fantasy (anthem, I guess you'd call it) plays. In short, the first hour of the game was just a PROLOGUE--like they have in books. I've played all the way up to FF9, but that title screen still impresses me. I hope you know that I'm writing all this from memory--that's how good this game is. Even now, USED copies of Final Fantasy cost ...

I'm not sure I had yet played Dragon Warrior, but I know that I had never heard of an RPG.  I received this game for Christmas one year and just started playing.  Even though the gameplay was so different and I only got to tell the characters what to do instead of controlling them, I was absolutely engrossed in the game.  I couldn't put it down.  I spent time fighting Imps, beating the Pirates in Pravoka, and venturing into the Marsh Cave (but not before level 9).  I loved this new game.Compared to RPGs today, Final Fantasy had an incredibly simple story.  The world is in trouble (naturally).  Four Fiends of Fire, Earth, Air, and Water have ruined the land.  A prophecy states that four warriors of Light would come to save the world.  You control these Light Warriors and get to pick the character classes of your party (Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, Red/White/Black Mage).  It is your quest to destroy this evil plaguing the land and restore the Crystals which give the land its strength.  You fight and level up your characters so that they will be stronger and are able to destroy the more difficult enemies.  You buy items to keep your characters strong.  You buy weapons and armor so that you characters will be able to fight more effectively and live longer.I only had two problems with this game when I was first playing it for the NES.  One: if one of your characters kills an enemy but another character is still targeting that enemy, your second character will attack the empty space where the enemy used to be.  That character wastes his turn.  It made me use a lot more strategy when fighting (which may have been the reason), but it didn't make sense.  If you were in a fight against a pack of wolves and your friend killed one, would you still fight the dead wolf or retarget against a live one?  Yeah, me too.  Two: This is a problem with the NES.  Since this is a battery backed game in order to save your progress, I had many instances of the save data erasing on me when I was hours and hours deep into the game.  That's probably why I can walk through the first portion of the game without and guidance whatsoever and it is only near the end that I have to try to remember what to do.There are games for the Nintendo that I like better, but Final Fantasy remains one of my all time favorite games and it is perhaps the most influential in my gaming life.

But the legends tells of four warrior legends that will arise to save the world from perish.Great story, don't ya' think so ? simple but fantastic.Music 4.5/5.0Some of the best of all of the early games, it's unique and memorable each and everything has gotten a theme (at least in the PSX version). As I said it's fantastic and memorable, the music has also becomed one of the Final Fantasy trademarks.Remember the legendary score from Final Fantasy VII? outstanding, no game series has caught my attention as the Final Fantasy series have, bless the composer.Graphics 3.0/5.0It's not fair to review the graphics as they're obviously dated, But there has been added some beautiful affects in PSX version, such as the spells and the characters has also been improved by far, good graphics and stunning affects.But don't dissmiss this game by it's graphics, give it a try.Remember it's classic and a very rare gem.Gameplay 5.0/5.0The best part, you get to choose who you want to make it through with, your choice is: Black Mage, White Mage, Red Mage, Warrior, Monk and Thief. Here's a list of the best combination you could possibly choose, here I go:Knight/Knight/Black Mage/White Mage.Strong defense and strong offense, the wariors are strong and has alot of HP and high Evasion rade and when classes changes it evolves into a Knight which can learn low White magic spells. Such as Cure2. And the White Mage stands for the healing and the black male stands for the highly effective black magis spells, make sure to get these: Flare, Haste, Ice3.

Sure, the music, graphics, game design and battle interface were all cutting edge at the time, but the first thirty minutes of this game may not win you over right away.I clearly recall beginning the game and finding it amusing, but somewhat dated and unimpressive.  I started out on my mission, fighting enemies, building experience, purchasing better weapons, magic, and equipment, following suggestions from local villagers and, eventually, I got to Garland: the first big boss.  After an impressive battle, he was defeated, and I smiled smugly, satisfied that I had overcome a major obstacle and gotten pretty far into this primitive adventure so quickly.Then I crossed the bridge, and the opening credits rolled.That experience defined FF1 for me.  Every time you think you understand the structure, parameters, and limits of the game, from modes of travel to impassable land masses and dead end oceans, the rules change in the most fun ways possible.  Canoes, ships, airships, undersea and above land levels, an ever expanding world map, robots and future technology (from the past), a gypsy market in the desert, a waterfall guarding a hidden entrance, a circle of wise men in a hidden clearing, and additional problems and challenges that pop up after you think you've done EVERYTHING you were supposed to do keep the game fresh and exciting throughout.Finally, to those that have criticized FF1 for being too difficult, I must disagree.  I have very little console RPG experience, yet my party never died, and I never spent time just trying to build experience before moving on to the next challenge.  I beat the game while at Level 29 without a problem.  Sometimes, it just takes a little strategy -- when to use heal spells versus heal potions, when to cure all hit points or just some, and when to let one character die so that the others may continue to live.  I actually respect that the game requires you to plan like that.  It makes the final victory more rewarding.  My only advice would be to consult an online walk-through tutorial at certain points as there are a few confusing moments where you'll have no idea where to go next without a helpful clue.  Also, stock up on those heal potions!FF1 is an amazingly innovative game.  It combines great design with an adventure that slowly and purposely unfolds in the most fun and exciting of ways.  When you finally slap in that cartridge and give this old dinosaur a try, don't judge too quickly.  You can be sure that it won't be long before the game starts shaking things up!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Don't Let the Primitive Technology Fool You...", "unixReviewTime": 1212796800, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2008"}

Rhodes", "helpful": [8, 10], "reviewText": "I'm an old school gamer and actually had my first shot at playing this in the Final Fantasy Origins package. I was pleased with that but I thought it would be much better to play the old original on the NES. I couldn't help it so I set out to find it and surprisingly, someone was willing to let me play their copy.Let me start off by saying no matter how you look at it whether its on Final Fantasy Origins or on the original NES that prologue is amazing! You start off by being asked to rescue a princess that's been captured by Garland.  So you head off to the Temple of Fiends (Temple of Chaos on FFO) and battle Garland the first boss in Final Fantasy history.  When you go back and return the princess the King will have the bridge rebuilt to the north. When you finally cross that bridge the words \"Final Fantasy\" appear on screen. That moment in my entire RPG career (well next to the opera scene in FFVI) will remain to be quite possibly my most memoriable. I've never seen an RPG do a prologue like that eversince. Not even FFIV's was that spectacular.Now I'm sorry but if you're like some people my age you don't really care for this and you'd much rather have the eye candy and so you're sitting around playing Final Fantasy X (sorry but eye candy sickens me!). But I found it very nice to play the origin of the series and it shows me now why Final Fantasy X isn't the best one in the series.Again, this is old-school and so the storyline doesn't get off to a great start. But I'd played Dragon Warrior and when I played Final Fantasy I was glad that it wasn't a save the princess deal (as most games on the NES I played were.).  It was actually a story about saving the world. Something that in the 80's I never got from gaming. The story paces a little slow but in the 80's when I played Dragon Warrior, that paced slow too.The storyline is actually one of my favorites in the series. You go around restoring the crystals that restore piece to the land. Then you go back 2000 years into the past and prevent any of the events from every happening.  It was one of the greatest in the series. Plus, it was actually FANTASY!My only gripe with the original NES version was what most people didn't like.  The fact that if all your characters targeted an enemy and the enemy died before all the characters attacked it they'd attack an empty space.  Luckily in the Final Fantasy Origins package this was remedied.  Still, one of the best Final Fantasy games in the series.

What saddens me is that there are a lot of Final Fantasy fans that have never played anything before 7. With 6 being the best Final Fantasy ever (I think) and 1 being the mother of it all, these people are missing out. Now onto the actual game- There is so much variety because you construct your own party. Though the story line is strictly linear, with no deviations, but it is still fun.

Sells aren't going so well for a small company known as Squaresoft...what are they to do?! They decide to release one last game, calling it &quot;Final Fantasy,&quot; thus being their final game if it doesn't sell good and appeal to fans. But, this definitiely wasn't the case, and thank goodness it wasn't.&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; was the start of the most well-known RPG series in the world. It sold really well and was successful enough to span many sequels, spinoffs, and whatnot. Released in 1987 in Japan, it wasn't released in the U.S. until 1990. Fans all over the world loved it.Well, first off, Final Fantasy is a very challenging game (at least the first time you play through it). You have to choose the classes for your characters at the beginning (Fighter, Thief, White Mage, Black Mage, Red Mage, and Black Belt). These will be the classes you keep throughout the entire game, with the exception of a small upgrade about 3/4th's or so through it. Your characters never talk, so there isn't much character development. What is there, though, is a game that was just simple and downright fun to play. There was no game that could be mistaken for a movie like the newer FF's (although I like every FF in a way). Just a simplistic game. Go to a town, talk to the townspeople, buy equipment, find out your destination, and repeat. At the same time, you will go into random battles. You must constantly watch your HP and make sure not to use up too much of your magic or your items.This is one of the most challenging FF's out there, but challenge is good. The story goes beyond the &quot;save the world&quot; theme, and was one of the first games to have a more complex story than your average RPG back then. It's really tough to find nowadays, so I would recommend going with &quot;Final Fantasy Origins&quot; for the PS One. You get FF I and II for 30 bucks, plus the graphics are upgraded to 16-bit quality, story makes more sense, there's more character interaction, and the music sounds better.

The reason for that was the lack of understanding of what to do. Eventually, it turned out to be lack of a map which was desperately needed. It's a huge world to be in, and there were too many hidden entrances, making the game unfair to play if a map wasn't supplied. Now, I have a chance to try the game again, and it turns out to be a better experience for it due to great supply of maps on the internet. I was able to complete Quests 1 and 2 with ease. Now, the question comes: is it really the greatest game I've ever played? Nope...way, way far from that truth. Ultimately, I found The Legend of Zelda a very boring game to play because about 90% of my wasted time was spent on farming for rupees. I was glad to have my monotony to be broken up every time I could go inside of a dungeon. To beat the game handily is to have the proper gear. That's what I knew in order to win. Now for the challenge, I found the game unbelievably simple, and most of the dungeons were a breeze for me. I was often skipping a lot of unnecessary rooms in there to get what I needed. All in all, just because The Legend of Zelda was a revolutionary game doesn't automatically mean it's the greatest game of all time; it was a quite boring game.

To save the princess, he basically has to go through hell with all the dangerous monsters he's forced to face along the way. A little guy like him has to stand up to THOUSANDS of monsters along the way. You really have to stay on your toes if you want to stay alive and finish the game. I love how such a simple story can stand up for years and years, and the gameplay never gets old because the game provides a perfect challenge.  All you fancy gamers out there today- you don't NEED a fancy story to have a solid video game.  Here's your example of that- find the princess and go through many different enemies and many difficult obstacles and complete them.  It's that easy... or is it?Swinging that sword and moving Link around is SO easy. I actually use the shield in this game.  How many times do I need a shield in video games?  Not often.I love how, every time I walk into a new screen, it's like walking into a new land, with a new challenge. Every area of the land and every area of the castle feels like it was carefully created and distinct. In every other Zelda game I've played, there were parts that were just boring to walk through and a chore to complete. Nothing like that in this game.  As I mention above: you are required to stay on your toes because of the very large amount of enemies just about everywhere you turn.  If you can't handle that, then don't play this game.It also feels really good when you go through a castle and defeat the boss. Even the very first one. It's amazing how the upbeat atmosphere of completing a castle can be so simple, and yet, so brilliant. Thanks to the heroic music, you really feel like you've just accomplished something big. I've been playing this game for over 15 years and even though I'm an adult now, there's a certain childhood feeling that immediately returns whenever I play this game. Having two quests featured in one game just makes the whole experience feel complete- it makes a great game almost perfect now. It blows my mind that a game from 1986 can be so enormous.  In fact, this game takes a lot longer to complete than most games out there today.I think if someone asked me what my favorite game of all-time would be, I might have to go with the original Zelda. Maybe Medal of Honor (the first one on the Playstation) would be my next choice.If you can't handle a difficult game, then don't bother playing the original Zelda.  You won't be able to handle it.  However, even though I'm not really a good gamer by any stretch of the imagination, I can still complete both quests.  It just takes a lot of time and patience.It makes you wonder what the first person who had to write a guide for this game was doing when he or she first found out there are hidden entrances around the land and inside the dungeons. If I remember right, don't you have to hold down on the directional pad for a few moments as you're facing a wall in order to access the hidden entrance? Imagine someone trying to find every single entrance in *every single screen* throughout the entire land. It would take longer than a lazy Sunday afternoon to find them all, that's for sure.Now imagine all the entrances that require bombs to access, and how someone would have to keep going through each screen and using them on every section of the wall, in the slim chance an entrance may be there. Then imagine that, when they run out of bombs, they have to keep going back and finding more, in order to experiment with them on the next section of land! We're talking hours and hours of gaming here.

You've never seen 2 happier kids in your life!LOL!  About a month later I picked up Zelda, the 1st & the beginning of what would become my collection of many Zelda games!  We would sit for hours on end helping each other explore Zelda's world, and battle thru each dungeon!  Thankfully, Dad wasn't into video games too much, so the three slots available for each new player worked out perfectly, as each of us had our own game slot to play!  What was nice is nobody fought over it, we each took turns playing and battling all those nastly little creatures that would kill us so many times and, unless we were in a dungeon....ya had to start over again! and again, and again, yes, me and my 2 kids were, & still are, very determined and headstrong! LOL  And talk about family dynamics, doing something together and working together, if we didn't before we got Zelda, we sure did after we got it! LOL We'd sit together, including Dad who didn't play but sure had ALOT of input after watching us for so long, and help each other, giving directions AND, thanks to a friend giving us a Nintendo Power Magazine that had the overworld map with all the Heart Container locations, where to bomb, what bushes to burn...etc, totaly working together in order to beat the game!  Absolutely an awesome, extremely addicting game!So here we are, over 20 years later, STILL playing that game! What does that tell you about....#1. the games re-play value? & #2. the total worth of the game?  In my opinion, this game is a deffinate keeper and if you DON'T have it.....GET IT!  I not only own this version of Zelda for my NES, I also own it for my Nintendo DS handheld game system with the GBA port! And YES, I still play it! LOL  I just purchased thru Amazon, the Collector Disc for the GameCube so that I can NOW enjoy Zelda & Zelda II (My #1 favorite of these 2 Zelda games) on my Wii!  YES!!  My husband, the non-video gamer, did end up becoming addicted to Zelda II: The Adventures of Link,which I purchased way back then for the Nintendo, not too long after getting addicted to this first one! So since we are \"new\" to the Wii, which he's not played yet, I can't wait until my Zelda Collector Disc arrives>>>>which SHOULD be today!! :)  I will be playing Zelda all over again on my Wii!  I truly beleive the game is that good!  Also, there's an \"underworld\" you can play after beating the game, it's the same as the \"overworld\" only they moved things around on ya and you have to type LINK into the game slot, now THAT'S some re-play for ya! LOLBesides Zelda I & II for the Nes and GBA, I also have Four Swords for the SNES & GBA, Minnish Cap-GBA, 2 LOZ's for my DS(which I also rate 5 star & are top of my list with LOZ I & II), 2 gamecube LOZ's for my Wii, Twilight Princess for the Wii AND a deposit down on LOZ's Skyward Sword coming out later this year for the Wii! Hmmm.....Think I'ma Zelda fan?  nah!! LOL!!This game is worth it's wait in GOLD, I don't think, or see how, it could EVER lose it's value OR it's \"re-play\" value! It, to me, has the right amount of difficulty level, just like most games out there, it gets tuffer & tuffer as you progress!  I LOVE the graphics, in all honesty, better than some of the newer, modern, updated Zelda games! I really think the best looking Link was the \"up-graded\" version they came up with in Zelda II, and also the easiest Link to control and maneuver around! So I'm going to have to say the same thing for the controls! The 1st time I sat down and played the newer Zelda games on my Wii, I had a heck of a time getting Link to run in a straight line or do what I wanted him to do WHEN I wanted him to do it! LOL! The controls for this original Zelda game on the NES were right on, no problems at all. I really do wish some of these newer ones had that same type of control & look to them. (my only exception would be my DS & GBA Zelda games with which I have NO problems with either on the handheld!)

Zelda was one of the biggest console games of the time, and that got gamers excited. Confusion aside, the game left players confounded with its intricate, wide-open design. Zelda was an action-adventure game with RPG elements, and in an age without the Internet, people were on their own about how to get through the game in one piece. Some people made maps. Others called Nintendo's own hotline for help or consulted a magazine. And some were fortunate enough to have friends who knew answers.

You control a green clad elf called Link on a quest to piece together the Triforce so that you can defeat Ganon and save princess Zelda.  You play the game from an overhead view which suits this game perfectly. The land of Hyrule consists of the overworld and the 9 dungeons spread out all over the map.  Your quest involves finding these dungeons (no easy task for some levels) and then defeating the boss to gain a piece of the triforce. Each dungeon is full of puzzles which get harder with each progressive level. Also items such as arrows, a raft or magic ring are hidden in the dungeons to make your quest easier.  The graphics in this game are nothing to rave about but what attracts most people to Zelda is the challange.  While the first few dungeons are not bad, the later levels like Death Mountain will make you stop and just stare at the map asking yourself \"Now how do I get into THAT room?\"  Not to mention trying to find all the heart containers outside the dungeons.  This game also packs replay value in that once the game is defeated a 2nd quest is presented. The difference this time is that the location of items and dungeons have been shuffled and the enemies are harder.

But lately I have been on a big Zelda kick the past 4 or 5 months I decided to review The Zelda games I own a while back I got a Nintendo 64 after my old N64 gave out after 12 or 13 years of service. Plus I bought a Gamecube to play Zelda Twilight Princess. So starting off I will review the original game The Legend Of Zelda on The NES. Released in 1987 not much story to tell on it cause it tells you the basic plot at the beginning. There is this Princess named Zelda who has been captured by Ganon who has came to this fictional country or kingdom whatever it is called Hyrule he wants this object of great power called The Triforce cause it can grant wishes if you wish for good things then good things happen if you wish for evil well evil things will go down. Ganon wants to take over the world what else. Zelda has broken The Triforce into 8 parts & there in 8 different dungeons & only 1 man can stop Ganon & that's Link or whatever you decide to call him. You start off & get a Wooden Sword most people go to the 1st dungeon but you can get 2 heart pieces & upgrade your sword. If you have full health then you can fire projectile's from your sword. There are different kinds of weapons you use to take care of your problems there is a bow & arrow which is in about every Zelda game except for Zelda II. A boomerange, bombs which can be used to blow open holes to make a passage way which that technique is used in a lot of Zelda games. You also have candles that let you see in dark rooms. When you get the wand & The Book Of Magic aka The Bible then candles become useless. You collect rupees which is the currency in Zelda to buy items. If you get up to 14 hearts then you get The Magical Sword a precursor to The Master Sword. If you have never played a Zelda game then there is a boss you fight at the end of each dungeon & if you are 1 of those people that haven't played a Zelda game then I don't know what's wrong with you you're missing out. The 1st boss Aquamentus is easy to beat especially when you have a real sword & it's even easier the 2nd time around when you have The Magical Sword. The 2nd dungeon has a boss known as a Dodongo which reappears in a couple more dungeons. In The 3rd Dungeon you face a Manhandla it does reappear in other dungeons. The Gleeok is the boss for the 4th dungeon. The 5th dungeon has a very easy boss called a Digdogger when you learn what to do it's the easiest boss in a Zelda game. Another sort of easy boss is Gohma it can be killed with 1 shot from your bow & arrow. Aquaments reappears as the boss for the 7th dungeon & Gleeok reappears as the boss for the 8th dungeon. Of course the last boss is Ganon himself & some say he's easy some say he's hard. Don't kid anyone he is difficult but not impossible. I'd actually say Ganon was hardest on A Link To The Past. Remember if it's your 1st time playing you need The Silver Arrows to kill Ganon. I always found it funny the names Nintendo gave to the enemies like The Skeltons are called Stalfos. The snakes are called Ropes. The Mummies are called Gibdos. The spider enemies are called Tektites & their mother spider is called Gohma. You also have different assortment of enemies like The Pol Voice, Vire, keese which are bats. Dark Nuts which I hate those things. Wizrobe's I hate those things too & Wallmaster's I really hate those things. You have these Centar creatures called Tynel's for some reason as a kid I though they were half human half dogs. Or those things called Peahats which as a kid I called them flying peaches or flying pineapples. The enemies always looked weird to me as a kid like The Pols Voice I called them I thought they were evil rabbits heads jumping around as a kid. The Zora I called devil fish. Bottom line is The Legend Of Zelda was fresh in 1986 & 87 cause of the adventure & puzzle solving. For the younger crowd who never played this game & have played the newer Zelda titles & decide to play any of the 2D Zelda games then you'll need a lot of free time & a lot of patience to complete it I don't care if you use cheats it still takes time to get through the game cause of all the time it takes to figure out dungeons.

This game does get better the more you play it, and you do get used to it, but I found myself just progressing in it a little bit at a time, partly due to difficulty, but mostly just because I got tired of it and wanted to play something more contemporary. The dungeons are actually good, but other than that there's just not much to do in the game. Travelling between dungeons is not nearly as fun here as it is in other Zelda games. This game is important as the first Zelda game that invented many conventions that are still used today, such as dungeons, the triforce, ganon, swords, and items such as bombs and the boomerang, but I mostly played and beat this game because it was a Zelda game, and I want to beat all of them.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The Legend of Zelda", "unixReviewTime": 1372032000, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2013"}

{"reviewerID": "A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR", "asin": "B00004SVXW", "reviewerName": "Mike London \"MAC\"", "helpful": [9, 12], "reviewText": "[I have written two Zelda reviews, one for the original NES release published June 14, 2001, and one for the Gameboy Advanced release [in 2004] for the Classic NES series, published June 15, 2004.  Mike London 12-1-2012]Review 1:  Released in the Stone Age of Video Games, this game stands as one of the most influential games ever released.  Nintendo players quickly sent the message to Nintendo by making this one of the most played games released on the old NES, with this release staying in the top ten games as voted by Nintendo Power readers for several years.  It would become the blueprint for RPG games, and its influence can be felt even now in the current game scene.  Others would take this and see what they could do with it, and because of this game the RPG became an established genre, although this will always be the game that started it and stands at the beginning, casting a very long shadow over its descendants.  But don't be mistaken, this RPG has some things that are very unlike its genre.  Levels are not built up (this would be the next installment), and magic and that were not big concerns.  Hearts were used instead of experience.  But these would be incorporated in the other release, so even then Zelda has its hands on that as well.So what is it about this game that so captured the imagination and the dollar of the average gamer?  Well, one was the incredible depth of adventure that just permeated the entire thing.  Released during a time when most games were side-scrollers, this set you in a world where you could explore and find items.  There is the now standard item list, where you obtain items and use them to interact with the world about you.  There are hidden dungeons that you must find, and you can burn bushes and push rocks, etc.  It radically opened the power of the NES console up, and the gaming world would never be the same after this game.To give a personal history, my brother and I got a Nintendo when it came out, playing all the standard games but somehow missing this one.  Although I played it, it was only in 1999 that I sat down and, for the first time in my life, played through the entire game.  It was amazing.  We had got the Super NES counterpart when it came out in 1991, so I knew that by heart.  This was just as great, although I still think the Super NES instatement,The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, is the best overall though I have not yet played the two new Gameboy releases,The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of AgesandThe Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons.  I'm sure they'll be great.By today's standards, the graphics are absolutely terrible, and by the standards of the day, they were only average.  But this proves only one thing: playability comes over a sleek looking graphical interface.  And this game has that.  Indeed, even now people call in asking Nintendo tips on this game.  Considering the NES has been dead for several years that is something indeed.  Of all things, this game desperately needs to be released on the Gameboy, packaged with the sequelZelda II: The Adventure of Link.As far as story goes, it is nowhere near as complicated as the games that came after it.  Essentially, Princess Zelda has been kidnapped and Link must regain the 8 pieces of Triforce to gain entrance to the ninth dungeon for the final showdown.  Musically, there are only three tracks, one for the Overworld (the now famous Overworld Theme, commonly called the Legend of Zelda Theme, which this game's N64's counterpart has been criticized for ostracizing, the dungeon theme, and the ninth dungeon theme.) After he beats Gannon the first time, a second quest opens up, meaning yet a whole other adventure.  The difficulty rating is greatly increased.  I personally think they should have down this with SUPER MARIO BROTHERS II, the Japanese version, now known in the States as THE LOST LEVELS.  It corresponds in difficulty to a second quest.  But that is neither here or there.  The great disappointment is that no one else took this to heart, and this is one feature that has not been a major influence on the RPG genre.  The second quest so enriched the game, giving the gamer more for his/her dollar, and I wish they'd do second quests more.As far as games go, \"The Legend of Zelda\"'s influence cannot be overestimated.  Truly one of the giants of the Gaming Universe.  This and SMB 3Super Mario Bros. 3are the best NES games by far.  Lets hope they re-release it soon!---------Review 2:  CLASSIC NES's best release. Wish they had included Zelda II, June 15, 2004.  (Four stars for the rerelease. Five stars for the actual game.)THE LEGEND OF ZELDA, one of Nintendo's most famous NES games, finally sees a rerelease on Gameboy Advance. People have been waiting a long time for this. The Super Mario series got its update (including a graphic overhaul) over a decade ago on the SNES as SUPER MARIO ALL-STARS, including a brand new (for the American market) game called THE LOST LEVELS. The two NES Zelda games, however, never got rereleased until the Game Cube (!), and on top of that, it was a promotional, free rerelease. All this being said, is the long wait worth it?Well, sort of. Although it's great to play the old school Zelda without hooking up a working NES, it's rather pricy at twenty dollars and the graphics may very well turn off younger video gamers. Not only that, it's very odd NINTENDO gave Zelda fans four Zelda titles in the ZELDA COLLECTION for free, and here they just released the original without any bonus material or extra features. Nintendo could very easily have included ZELDA II on this cart as well. That being said, THE LEGEND OF ZELDA, of all the classic NES games re-released, is one of the few that justify's its pricetag. The rest could easily have been put in an anthology of classic NES games, instead of bringing each one out separately.The gameplay of THE LEGEND OF ZELDA sets up the template followed by all subsequent games in the series. (Only the NES sequel has any real amount of deviation from the Zelda formula, bring in more RPG elements into the mix). You play as Link, a hero in green, who has to rescue Zelda from the evil megalomaniac, Gannon. Not to much of a story, but about as good as you got in the mid 1980s. You have to rescue eight pieces of the Triforce, which is a mystical triangle (one of three). These triforce fragments are hidden throughout the world map in various dungeons. Items you get in one dungeon gives you access to other dungeons, and as you progress, you get various upgrades for your sword and pick up new items. After you beat Gannon the first time, then a second quest opens up, with items, dungeons, and shops in entirely different locations. I wish they had released a special edition of SUPER MARIO BROTHERS with the Japanese version of SMB II as a `second quest.\" But oh well. Unfortunately, the second quest never really caught on with other games. The Second Quest is harder than the first. To get to the Second Quest at the beginning of the game, put \"ZELDA\" as your name.The game itself is very nonlinear, which is what made it such a popular game. There was the incredible depth of adventure that just permeated the entire thing. Released during a time when most games were side-scrollers, this set you in a world where you could explore and find items. There is the now standard item list, where you obtain items and use them to interact with the world about you. There are hidden dungeons that you must find, and you can burn bushes and push rocks, etc. It radically opened the power of the NES console up, and the gaming world would never be the same.Ironically, though, some may find ZELDA too challenging for this very reason. Bereft of any real narrative, ZELDA doesn't give you any real direction where to go next, save for the infamous, sometimes incomprehensible old men who give you `clues' on where to go next. If you don't know where you're going, you'll find yourself wondering around a lot, mostly directionless. That's what made the game so popular in the first place, but for modern games it may be off-putting how difficult it is to find some of the dungeons without some internal direction from the game. (As a perfect example, just think how many bombs you would have to use to find the very obscure ninth dungeon on the second quest.) The SNES installment gives you visual indicators on where to bomb, etc; the original ZELDA does not give you visual ques on anything. So unless you know the game well or you have access to walkthroughs, expect a lot of time just trying to figure out where to go next.The graphics, while looking rather archaic by today's standards, holds up rather well given its age. The sprites are bright and the scenery is colourful. There's only a few instances where you can tell that the screen was squished to adapt to Game Boy Advance's screen, but this isn't very noticeable. The music is a near perfect port too, making this a very faithful recreation of the original. For those old enough to remember the NES glory days, the graphics will bring back a lot of memories; for new gamers, however, they may find it difficult to get over the primitive graphics and into the game itself. Their loss.Conclusion: One of the few NES CLASSICS worth shelling out twenty bucks for. Still, it's rather puzzling they didn't include anything extra, or even the second NES Zelda game, given they released both ZELDA and ZELDA II, plus the two N64 games, on one spectacular, free collection for GameCube. For those who never played the original Zelda, this will hook you for life. There's no better way to start playing this historic series than the original. For those of us old enough to remember the NES, this is a great game, and a great way to relive very fond memories. Still, if you don't have the Zelda Collection, this is a very worthwhile purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the greatest and most influential games ever released", "unixReviewTime": 992476800, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2001"}

My dad used to play this an super mario brothers all the time and so did i later on. Although i never got to beating this game (got bored after beating level 5), its still very fun to play. The only thing i hated about the game was not the challenge, but when you almost die and your life meter beeping like hell. This is my most favorite zelda game because its the only one where it really doesnt tell you where to go next. What i mean by this is after you beat a temple, someone or something doesnt say anything on the next location but dont worry, each temple you enter says what level it is so you know if your supposed to beat it or not *ex: i beat level 1 an 2 but then i find level 6. I turn back because i never beat level 4 an 5 to aquire the certain items in those temples in order to get past level 6*. There are also caves containing townsfolk where you buy valuable items, information, or free info and tasks. Now, thats just the underworld part, the overworld is a huge map with areas like forests, mountains and such with monsters, caves, temples (levels), and secrets all over the land and like i said, i like this zelda game the most because you always got to figure out where to go next which can take longer than you think if you dont use and guides or FAQS. And thats more than half of the game; wandering in circles, solving mysteries to get to the next location, searching for upgraded items such as swords or boomerangs, finding temples, caves, defeating bosses in temples with each boss having its own stragety where you need to figure out its weakness by using countless items on it.

No more entering long passwords and making a small mistake when writing them down, which could lead to having to start over from the beginning. There are 3 files, so at least 3 people can keep a save file. The battery is supposed to go dead after 5 years or so, but if you take good care of the cartridge, it'll last a whole lot longer.The Zelda's have always been about the gameplay, and the original certainly doesn't disappoint. You start out in front of a cave, where you'll find your first sword. From there, this excellent adventure game begins. There is an overworld, where you'll go around searching for dungeons, finding places to buy items, and getting stuff such as heart containers. The underworld, or the dungeons, are where you'll do most of the fighting. You move from room to room, getting keys, beating all the bad guys in a room, and finding clues from wisemen who are located in almost every dungeon. There are 9 dungeons in all, in addition to an item (or 2), a map, and a compass in each. Plus, at the end of each dungeon, you'll have a boss to deal with. You must first beat the first 8 dungeons to get into the 9th. At the end of these first 8 dungeons, you'll find a piece of the Triforce of Wisdom. Collect all 8 to enter the final dungeon to defeat Ganon and save Zelda. I think the challenge of this game is moderate on the 1st quest, and moderate to hard on the 2nd quest.The story was also very advanced for its time. You're a young boy named Link. The evil Ganon has kidnapped Zelda, because she had in her possession the Triforce of Wisdom. However, before she was kidnapped, she broke the Triforce into 8 pieces and hid them, and she also sent her nursemaid, Impa, to find a hero who could save her. Impa was attacked by enemies, and Link saved her from them. From there, this great adventure starts. As mentioned before, you must go through the 8 dungeons, get all 8 pieces of the Triforce, then enter the 9th to fight Ganon and rescue the kidnapped Princess Zelda.This is one of my favorite Zelda's, and one of the most fun games of all-time. It's very easy to just pick up and start playing, and it has VERY good replay value. You can even go through the quest a 2nd time after you beat it, but it's a whole lot tougher, and the dungeons are even different, including them being located in different places throughout the overworld.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys action/adventure games. Hint: If you want to start off on the 2nd quest without going through the 1st, enter your name as \"ZELDA\" at the beginning. But be warned: the 2nd quest is incredibly challenging compared to the 1st.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The start of the Zelda series...", "unixReviewTime": 1056758400, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2003"}

It was released in 1988 for the NES and was the first Zelda game to cause quite a stir because it was revered and loathed at the same time. I won't get into the huge debate that still rages on to this very day. All you need to know is that even though it doesn't \"look\" like the first game, it is still a Zelda game and advanced the story line while it added new game play mechanics, characters and a quest that made it quite unique.This was an excellent sequel to the classic NES game, The Legend of Zelda. It brought the RPG aspect found in RPG games mixing it with side scroller action found in most platforming games at the time. It's also a pretty hard game and the challenge stays with you. Though you could find the original NES cartridge, you can settle for tracking down the GBA cart instead and it probably won't cost as much. You can also find this title on Nintendo's Virtual Console Service and buy it for 500 points (US $5.00) If you haven't played this game and are still hung up about taking a chance on it, look at some YouTube videos to get an idea.I loved this game and have the original NES cartridge. It didn't deserve to be branded as the black sheep of the Zelda series just because it was radically different from the first game.

Some fans of the series hate this game because it's not like the others. It's certainly different, but Zelda II is still a good game. It's exploration style isn't as good as the original, but it more than makes up for that with nonstop action.Story: It's Sleeping Beauty with elves and magic triangles. Link turns 16, which point he develops a strange crest with triangles on his hand. Impa, Zelda's handmaiden, tells him this means he must awaken Princess Zelda -- not the Impa's Zelda, a different earlier Princess Zelda. (The English version of the game never really clarifies that point.) To accomplish this, Link needs to place six crystals in well-guarded places. Doing this will not only awaken the Princess, but usher in an age of prosperity for all Hyrule (if I recall correctly). So, Link sets off on his most adventuresome journey yet.Gameplay: Unlike the original Legend of Zelda's four-directional overhead gameplay, most of the actual gameplay takes place in a side-scrolling environment. There is an overworld map, but it's only used to reach the side-scrolling areas. WHile your walking through the overworld, enemies spawn and chase you. If they catch you, a battle scene appears, making you fight through to continue your walk through the overworld.Music: Zelda II's soundtrack is a vast improvement over the original Legend of Zelda. It rocks, my friend. It's geared for action and slicing down thousands of the late Ganon's minions. You've your got standard \"Oh, we're in a town!\" music, but main draws are the dungeon, Great Palace, and battle-scene themes. Also, the title theme is pretty nice, and the overworld theme is a nice remix of the classic Zelda theme.Difficulty: It's quite a commitment to finish this game. It starts off with an average difficulty, and then it quickly goes from hard to unbelievably hard. So many of the enemies deal incredible amounts of damage, and many will hit you multiple times if you're not careful. Good reflexes coupled with the good sense to level up are requirements. You only have three lives, and a game over starts you back at the beginning of the map.And if you're playing this game on original hardware, there are multiple things which bring it from hard to nigh unbeatable: The NES games with internal batteries are terrible about abruptly erasing their data if you don't hold down the reset button... or you hold it the wrong way. This is even more true if your NES' pin connector is dying, which causes the system to repeatedly reset and triggers something in game's battery. Find a top-loader NES if you want to play it on original hardware. Otherwise, you might do well to just buy one of the game's several ports.At the time of this writing, modern Zelda games in the style of the original are routinely criticized as being the same game over and over again. One can only wonder what kind of reception a follow-up to the completely unique side-scrolling Zelda II might get. I'd play that, and if you like an enjoyable yet frustrating challenge, you should play this game.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Mark of The Triforce!", "unixReviewTime": 1343433600, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2012"}

When you start off, Princess Zelda is unconscious or something--too many beers at the Ganon-is-dead party? Once again, Link goes out to save the world. The biggest change in this game is this: Maps are top-down like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy (semi-random battles, too), but the towns and dungeons are in the side-view. The side-view graphics are good, but I wish they'd stick to the original format that was used in the first game. Throughout the game, Link can learn different sword techniques--up thrust, down stab, maybe one other. It certainly adds more strategy to the game. Also, Link can use magic spells. Once again there're tons of dungeons to go into, with the only differences being the ending bosses, mazes, and colors. The last battle in this game is pretty interesting--Link fights his own shadow--but is either too hard or too easy. At first I had the hardest time because the shadow mirrors your every move. But after about the fifth time, I figured it out and whooped him good in under a minute. So much for the ever-so-difficult ending boss.

I am being honest if I want to play Zelda this wouldn't be the 1st game I'd pop in I would go for the 1st game or my favorite A Link To The Past or Ocarina Of Time, Majora's Mask or Twilight Princess which I finally got around to playing I can say each time I play it I like it more & more. Zelda II was released in January of 1987 in Japan & in December of 1988 in The US. So really it was rushed in Japan & btw The Japanese love hard games The Japanese version of Super Mario Brother 2 is very hard so much so that they took another game & put Mario characters in it. I don't know if it would've worked out if they had done the same thing for Zelda II so it's probably best they didn't. Zelda II is unique cause it's a side scroller & it put in more RPG elements. Both the original Zelda on The NES & A Link To The Past on SNES were both overhead games & were more of an adventure game than an RPG. This game doesn't use rupees you have to to rely on experience points & special skills you get in towns when you talk to the old men or knights or the gear or tool you find in towns. So it does have a novelty of being a full RPG & not just RPG elements. There are your typical easy enemies outside in Hyrule & in the 1st few dungeons & the dungeons aren't too bad. The bosses I think are more unique than the original Zelda. I might as well get into the story Ganon was defeated in The Legend Of Zelda but there are still members of Ganon's clan that still worship him & they have what's left of Ganon & the only attempt to bring Ganon back to his pig like glory is they need to kill Link & use his blood to revive Ganon. Link has came back to Hyrule cause he needs to attain The Triforce Of Courage hidden in The Great Palace so evil couldn't get their hands on it. Impa tells Link a story about when The King Of Hyrule died & left the kingdom to Zelda A Wizard tells The King's Son that his sister knows where the 3rd piece of The Triforce is at The Wizard threatens to put a sleeping spell on her. She won't give the location out so she is put under the spell but The Wizard dies right after. So this Zelda has been asleep for hundreds of years. Impa gives Link these 6 gems to place in 6 dungeons to get to The Great Palace. So the remaining followers of Ganon see this as their time to strike & believe me you they are p  i  s  sed at you. You start off with Moblins & bits & bots going after you but then you have these Tektites that are the hardest they have ever been & you have to have the fire spell that shoots fireballs out of your sword to kill them. Not only that you have to deal with these axe wielding enemies called Daria's annoying enemies like Megmat's & these things called Moa's that fly all over the screen. Bago Bago are very annoying & can get in your way & they can knock you off into a pit or whatever & you lose a lifewhich if you lose all 3 lives then it's game over return of Ganon you lose all your experience points I don't know if you lose all your tools or not. I can forgive the difficulty cause a lot of NES games were hard so no problem with it's difficulty but I can't give the 3 lives & you start over the pass.  Another enemy that is bad news is Iron Knuckles the blue Partetamce, The Wizrobe's & even worse in the 3rd dungeon they look like member of TheK  K  K. You have these things called Ra's that fly across the screen they're in the way. The Bubles steal your magic for no good reason & you need magic & you need as much as possible mainly the shield spell, life spell & later on the thunder spell. The attacks you learn like the down thrust come in real handy especially for The Rebonack boss. I will talk about some fo the magic you get the shield spell lets you take less damage when hit. A jump spell that makes you jump higher. Which that spell is also great in boss battles. The life spell does what it says it regains some of your health again great in boss battles. The fairy spell Link turns into a Fairy no comment here. Reflect Spell it knocks back attacks such as The Wizrobes attacks. The spell spell which turns some enemies into bits & bots. The Thunder spell which makes 1 of the last bosses Thunderbird. This game as I said has better bosses than the 1st game well except for the 1st 2 temple the 1st dungeon's boss is Horse Head & in the 2nd temple you have Helmet Head. The 3rd temple you face Rebonack. The 4th temple you face Carock it's rememberable  cause the way you defeat it is using the reflect spell & it doesn't take much to beat it. Gooma in the 5th dungeon is was sort of difficult but not impossible. Volvagia makes it's 1st appearance as Barba in the 6th dungeon it's not as great as the battle in Ocarina Of Time. In The Great Palace you face Thunderbird which you got to learn the pattern to beat it well. Then when you get The Triforce Of Courage you face Dark Link which is an evil version of Link. He's not much of a problem if you know the special method. I fell The Adventure Of Link Zelda II is worthy of being in the franchise. Shigeru Miyamoto must of enjoyed the mental torture this caused back in the day though. This game is all about preference as I said in my Zelda NES review you'll need some patience but not only patience for Zelda II but a lot of coffee & some kind of tobacco product & I won't fault you if you decide to use a Game Genie for this game. This game also established stuff like The Triforce Of Power, Wisdom & Courage. The towns was used more in future Zelda titles. There isn't much more I can say except I will review my favorite Zelda game The Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past next.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Adventure Of Link Zelda II review", "unixReviewTime": 1373846400, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2013"}

I couldn't believe how bad and how difficult at was at first. The overworld is absurd, as you cannot use your sword, and there are no conventional enemies. Every ten seconds three enemies appear and it's like pac-man in that you have to run and try to avoid them. If they run into you, you are forced into this new screen of enemies. You can either fight them at this point or leave the screen and return to the overworld.This game is very annoying at first, but you sort of get used to it. I tried to make progress in this game countless times and gave up on it within minutes. It doesn't even seem like a Zelda game. It is playable though once you figure out how it works. It helps to consult a walkthrough or a Youtube video to get help, as there are a lot of cryptic places where you get stuck and there's no way to know that there's a wall you can walk through or a certain grave that you can fall into unless you consult a walkthrough.The dungeons are side-scrolling, so they're basically the opposite of the first Zelda game. A really annoying thing is that every time you die you have to start at the very beginning of the game. So you have to complete a palace in its entirety, or else you have to start from the beginning. You still do keep items and stuff like that, and going through the dungeon the second or third time is much easier, but it gets really tiresome. It's easily the worst thing about the game.There are points in this game that seem virtually impossible. I felt like some of them require 50+ attempts before you beat them, and that's a lot for a game like this. The worst is the very last dungeon. It is incredibly hard. The last boss took me so many times to beat. There's also a boss right after that one. Fortunately, there's a technique to beat this boss that makes it about the easiest boss in the game, but if you don't know it you'll probably never beat the game.Overall, I would only recommend this game to Zelda completists who want to beat every game. The Adventure of Link does some things right, but it's far from a success. If you can get used to this game it is a good challenge, and the palaces are kind of different and almost fun at times, but the difficulty is just too much for the average gamer. The graphics are also very dated. Also, as with the Legend of Zelda, there's nothing at all good about the game outside of the dungeons.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The Adventure of Link", "unixReviewTime": 1372032000, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2013"}

When I first saw this game in action, I already had the first one and was deeply in love with it. Understandably, this game turned me off instantly! I couldn't bear to see Link with sqare bars in his life gauge and with three continues. Early the next year (1996) I bought Zelda 3 and beat it in less than a month. Then towards the end of that year I decided to try this out again. And so it is worth noting that I had conquered both the first and the third game when I finally bought this. Now to the game...In Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, a Princess called Zelda (not the one from the original) has been put to an eternal sleep by an evil magician long ago. Link decides to remain in Hyrule after his first adventure, and on the day of his 16th birthday, a mark appears on his hand. When he seeks Impa's help, he learns that as the chosen one he himself must undo the &quot;binding force&quot; and enter the Great Palace in the Valley of Death. For what? To win back the Triforce of Courage, of course. Only the combined power of the Triforces of wisdom, power and courage can awaken the princess from her slumber. Well that's the story. You can draw your own conclusions...This game has two types of scenes: the &quot;land map&quot; and the &quot;action scene.&quot; In the land map a minuscule Link moves through various landscapes like roads, forests, plains and deserts, until he bumps into one of two types of enemy symbols. When Link runs into these or enters a town or palace, the land map quickly changes to the action scene. Here is where you can use the sword and magic as well as interact with people and objects. This is basically how Zelda II plays. Yes, it's different but unique. After all, it would've been a bit lame if Nintendo just released a replica of Zelda 1 labelled Zelda II, would it not?Now to the graphics. The land map graphics are primitive (even for NES standards), but the action scene graphics (where it really counts) are quite good. They are much better than Zelda 1. Link is not dwarf-ish anymore and the villages, palaces and end-bosses are decent, even today. Music-wise, again it's quite good. The village theme is lovely. The cave and palace music fit their atmosphere very well. The Great Palace music is also great! The Zelda theme is a little different in this game. Anyway, it's a refreshing change. The sound effects are fair too.The game controls are fluid. But Link's jumping capacity (till you find the &quot;jump&quot; magic) is low and his sword is more like a knife (and you can't upgrade it)! As for gameplay, there are no boomerangs, bombs, rupees and arrows. Was that a scream I heard? Don't worry, things really aren't that bad, though. Link has a life bar and a magic bar which can be increased by finding heart containers and magic jars. Rupees are replaced by experience points. Once you reach a required level you can upgrade either your life, magic ability or strength. All three can be upgraded to level 8. In the eight or so towns you can learn new magic and sword skills. The game is also quite challenging to boot. Enjoy the Great Palace! Ganon makes a cameo each time Link dies, but he is not a boss in the game.In ending my review, I have to say if you still have an NES, you should buy this game. Zelda fans should definitely give it a try. Even if you don't like the other Zelda games, this may appeal to you. This game was ranked number 72 in EGM's top 100 games of all time list 4 years ago.

One of the most controversial games of that era, players sent a clear message to Nintendo, saying the sequel didn't live up to its predecessor.  People still bought it, but the general consensus was it was not as good as the original \"Legend of Zelda\".  The biggest controversy of this game was it was a 2D scroller, instead of an overhead game like the original was.  You navigated in an overhead view.  Then the battles and actual dungeons are in the side scrolling format. Another big factor is this game is HARD.  VERY HARD.  It's also the only Zelda where you collect lives.  If you run out of lives and continue, instead of starting back at a particular dungeon's beginning, you begin at the very start of the game.  When we're talking about trying to beat the Great Palace, this turns into a nightmare.  There is also an unwieldy magic and leveling up system.  The magic continued in the Zelda series.  The leveling did not.  But because it was such a radical departure, and not wholly successful, Zelda II is viewed as a flawed, if interesting, game.The Zelda name does great damage here, because people come in expecting overview.  Zelda II tries to be innovative with an uneasy hybrid of side-scrolling and overworld.  Had it been released as just a fantasy game, I think Zelda II would be something of a cult classic.  As it stands, people constantly judge this game on the Zelda name alone, instead of giving the game a chance.  That's what really hurts Zelda II.Zelda II is a misunderstood game.  The true question, which cannot be answered, is this: \"What would the public think if this had been released first, instead of The Legend of Zelda?\"  Who knows?  No one does.  People expected the wrong things from this game.  People wanted traditional Zelda action, and this game didn't have that.  It's a hybrid of overhead and platform gaming.  This was one of Nintendo's biggest missteps in its history.  They had misread the audience.  All this has forever damaged Zelda II.  It will always be viewed from the perspective it is not as good as the other Zelda games.Without Zelda II, the structure of this seminal series would be drastically different.  In terms of lessons learned, this is by far the most important game in the series.  What if Nintendo hadn't done this game?  It is possible they might have tried the hybrid on SNES version.  Nintendo learned from its mistake, and never tried this again.  In the Zelda context, that is a good thing.Zelda is a great series, and without this under their belt, Nintendo might have put out a disappointing Zelda game at a much more crucial time in the series' evolution.  It's a great game in and of itself, and had it been redesigned in terms of story and not making it Zelda, it would be considered a classic.  But for Zelda it doesn't go with the others, and Nintendo learned what the public wants in a Zelda game.  In terms of sticking to the formula, this is the best thing that ever happened to Zelda.  If they had not released this game on the NES, they might have tried the hybrid experiment on the SNES game, and instead of getting what is arguably the greatest game on the SNES, and in the Zelda series, we would get a game like this.  Then, we wouldn't get a  game for the SNES comparable to Link to the Past.  If Nintendo had not made this game, they would have made this mistake (remember, it's a mistake only in context of the series) at a much worst time.What about Super Maria Brothers 3?  Although Zelda II was viewed as a disappointment, I think it had direct influence on SMB 3.  SMB 3 is the game Zelda II could have been.  SMB 3 successfully combined a type of overview world, but then you moved and played the stages.  Of course, the world in Zelda II was much more expansive.  The SMB series was already a side scroller.  It is hailed as one of the greatest NES games ever released.  And yet, earlier when they tried the same thing with Zelda II, it was viewed as a disappointment because Zelda was not a side scroller to begin with.  Nintendo took the hybrid idea into Mario, of which it was much more suited.  Mario was not an overview game to begin with.  When they did make the hybrid, they stuck with the basically formula of side scrolling, but they had a little overview too.In this view, Zelda II is out of balance.  In the series' context, they should have made more of the action overview, instead of all side-scrolling.  Some main parts of the game should be like that though, but then there should be more old-school Zelda overview.  As it stands in the series, its out of balance.  But without it, we might not have the hybrid of the overview/side scrolling found in SMB 3 and Super Mario World, which both are great games.  Independently, Zelda II stands proud.After all these years, Zelda II still occupies that weird uncle status in the Zelda family tree.  I personally think that it's a great game.  It stands as a failure in the context of the series.  Had it been released without the Zelda moniker, I think history and players would have been much more receptive to this charming (if entirely too difficult) game.*An interesting note about its title.  This is the only Zelda game it incorporate the numerical sequence into its official title.  Its also the only title in the series that does not have \"The Legend of Zelda\" in it.  Its just \"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.\"  It sounds better than \"The Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link.\"  Too long I guess for those days", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Failure of Link?", "unixReviewTime": 1100649600, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2004"}

Gannon was defeated in the previous game so he's nowhere to be seen, unless its game over (he returns after his minons and guardians feed him blood from a defeated Link).  A now late teenaged Link must awaken Princess Zelda (not the same Princess Zelda we all know, but a decendant from hundreds of years ago) from multi-century long slumber due to a wizard's evil spell.  In order to awaken Zelda, Link must obtain the Triforce of Courage from the Great Palace, but in order to unlock the palace, he must place six crystals on the stone statues of six different palaces that are guarded by six of the late-Gannon's guardians.  Some of Gannon's minor minions like Stalfos, Moblins, and Octoroks return to give Link more trouble but Link faces some of the most annoying minor enemies in video game history like the multi life sucking Dairas (those annoying axe weilding/thowing mutant alligators) and Ironknuckles (a more stubborn upgrade from Darknuts from the previous Zelda game who comes in three different forms).Unlike other Zelda titles, Link does not gain any upgrades on his armor, sword, and shield (according to the instruction manual, Link still uses his magical sword and shield he upgraded to in the first Zelda game), but you gain expeirence points in attack strength, life, and magic (a new feature in the Zelda game that will revisted in A Link To The Past and a few other games).  You do go into an attack mode as you run into a weak or strong enemy images floating around on the overview, but you don't take turns attacking like most traditional role playing games so Zelda II was very innovative for its time. Also another first is Link can go to different Hyrule towns to talk to select people for secrets to progress throughout the game or to learn new magic spells (from a town wizard) and offensive moves (like the upward jump sword thrust and downward stab sword thrust from a local swordsman).  Due to all these added features mentioned, this game acts more of like a role playing game with some minor modfifications.  Due to the success of the game, Castlevania II: Simon's Quest emulated its game play to the fullest with little excitement and more mundane objectives.  Despite of its difficulty, it was a fun game and a timeless classic of which many fans would dissmiss.  Many players complained due to the strong difficulty, but thats why there existed a battery genrated saved feature so you can try again.  The only disadvantage compared to the first game is that if its \"Game Over,\" you go right back from the beginning, literally.  You don't start from the beginning of the palace, unless you loose all your lives at the Great Palace.  I also don't like the fact that you loose all of your expeirence points when you die.  Another minor complaint I have is that you are only confined by your sword for protection.  It would've been nice if Link had more variety of weapons like a boomerang or arrows because these offensive magic spells are too costly and the game is a bit stingy when it comes to refilling his magic meter (full magic bottles are rare).  Other than that, its a pretty good game, yet it is probaly condered the last adventure for Link due to the fact that all future Zelda releases were taken place before the first Zelda game.

It will definitely test your ability to inflict and dodge attacks.  Your life preserving strategies will get quite a workout too.  You've got to be on the ball if you want to get through this game.  Even with maxed out stats, you can't just plow through the game and take hits.  Heck, even with max strength I wouldn't mess with those knife-throwing eagles.  I just ran away from them, and still somehow lived.There's no way you can beat this game without a walkthrough.  No freaking way.  Way too many dangerous mazes and unobvious methods to get items.  And you need ALL of the items to get through the game.  You can't just pick and choose.  You need to have the thunder spell to beat the boss, and you need to have all the magic containers to get the spell, see.There are really only two places where you'd get stuck in this game.  Unfortunately one of the places is right at the beginning and the other is right at the end.  At the beginning, Death Mountain really is DEATH mountain.  I can't think of any way to get through it except by building up experience points like crazy and leveling up several times.  Those red alligator cavemen are monstrous.And at the end, well, just walking along the path from the giant spider to the Great Palace is a heck of a challenge.  Dinosaur men throw barrages of rocks at you with the accuracy of snipers, and one-eyed ghosts fly around randomly, knocking you into lava and zapping away whatever lives you have.  Thank goodness if you actually make it to the Great Palace, you can continue from there.What really makes this game so different from the other Zelda games is the jumps.  In Zelda 1 and 3, there aren't really any jumps, and if you miss a jump in Zelda 4, its not really all that big of a deal.  Start where you left off and try again.  But if you miss a jump in Zelda 2, it costs you dearly.  Miss three of those and you're back at the beginning, and believe me, there are plenty of enemies around to help you miss those three.The odd thing though, is that while the combat system and the required jump-dodging are what makes this game hard as heck, they also are what make the game good.  After some practice, you'll be impressed at what you're able to do.  Especially once you figure out how to get past those boomerang guys.  The controls are practically flawless, and my only complaint about them is Link's sword is too short for the upward thrust to be particularly effective.  Half the time I'd use that attack I'd take damage instead of give it.Quite primitive, and definitely not as good as Zelda 3 or 4, but it has some neat items and spells, and its definitely a man's game.

Heres the deal: side scrolling games only existed for a short while. If Zelda had never ventured into the side scrolling genre, people would always have wondered what Zelda as a side scroller would have been like, if Zelda had played a little like Mario. And contrarywise, if Zelda 2 had just been a rehashed copy of the original, it would have been stale, and A Link To The Past might not have been as good.Its got RPG elements. What i really love about this game is how important magic spells are. They become your true weapons. The fireball spell and the jump spell and the shield spell are essentials. The enemies are challenging, the dungeouns are challenging.One thing I always felt that I dont know if people tend to agree with it the bosses. They have a semi-evil feel. Like Carock, the evil hooded Wizard, or the Dragon in the lava. They are also challenging.Finally, it wouldnt be fair if i didnt talk about the final obstacle. Just getting to the final palace is tough. You only have 3 lives. And the last palace is big and difficult. The last boss...ThunderBird, is very hard, requires alot of your magic just to be able to fight him. And if you beat him, you get the super hard Shadow Link. Truly, Shadow Link can be beaten quite easily if you fight him kinda cheaply.It took me a long time to be able to beat this game. But after beating it, I decided that this was alot of fun, and in my opinion, better than the original. Most dont see it that way, sadly. Many even hate this game because of its difficulty. It takes patience and mastery.

There's really only ONE minor flaw- on more than one occasion, you'll find yourself inside a room that appears to be exactly the same as a room you've been to before, but with very minor changes separating the two, such as enemies in one room, and nothing in the other room.  That's it.  Some occasional *minor* confusion understanding the difference between a few of the rooms.That's the only problem with the game.  Even then, the game is pretty small so you shouldn't have THAT much of a hard time with it.  You shouldn't be spending THAT much time confused and scratching your head where to go and what to do.There's nothing else to complain about.  The original NES Metroid *is* a classic.  The excellent theme music in EVERY SINGLE AREA OF THE GAME, the constant arcade-style shooting action (and need I remind you that NO other Metroid game gives you *this* much shooting action) the creepy atmosphere of being stuck inside a dark planet with enemies that seem to crawl, fly, or zig zag all OVER the place, constantly.  It's a lot of fun shooting or avoiding these enemies, and the game is so much fun words can't even describe how GREAT the experience is.  Replay value indeed.I was a child in the 80's and remember playing this game over and over as I found new areas and felt the excitement when I finally figured out what I was supposed to do.  Remember the first time we reached that part near the beginning where we had to work our way UP that lengthy blue-colored area with spikey creatures crawling around and rippers flying back and forth?  Remember when we said to ourselves \"Man, is this thing ever going to END or am I supposed to keep climbing forever?\"  And remember when we finally found a door after all that climbing and breathed a sigh of relief?  Didn't you realize this game was something much different from the other NES games at the time?  THAT'S what makes a game a classic.There was nothing else like this game back in the day.  A space shooter that was ALSO an action game with fantastic gameplay, and even a platformer for that matter.  The game requires lots of climbing and exploring.  The music in the more maze-like areas fit *extremely* well with the confusion of trying to find your way out of each area.  Absolutely a great game.Sure, it's short by todays standards, but the two hours it takes for me to blow through the game is time well spent.  The password system was also really cool because you had to write down extremely long passwords.  This is a good thing because there's a mysterious feeling to the dead quiet sound of a password appearing on screen after you were killed.People who dismiss this game are spoiled by either Super Metroid's superior graphics and gameplay, or even worse, spoiled by the drastically different Metroid Prime games.  Remember, I was AROUND in the 80's and got to experience this classic game when it was brand new.  That's why I can appreciate it for the masterpiece it is.  Atmosphere, gameplay, music, memories, that dreaded feeling of hopelessness and fear when you believed you were stuck in certain areas, you name it.  This game has it all, baby.Don't be afraid of a challenge (though I've never believed the game was as difficult as most people) and don't be afraid of a game that's old.

From 1985, it has appeared on almost every Nintendo console released to the world and continues to evolve in terms of style, art direction, storyline and game play. While you can play the very first installment in this great series on the Wii via the Virtual Console service, most people who had the NES experienced it right here.You take control of Samus Aran, a female bounty hunter, who travels throughout space to help maintain order between the planets. Your mission wass to find and destroy Mother Brain, an evil entity out to take over the world with her army of various aliens. Back in 1985, this game blew the doors of what a contemporary game should be. Much like Super Mario Bros. set the standards for the once popular but now almost non-existent platform game, Metroid set the standards for the adventure genre with its branching paths to different worlds, various power suits and weapons. Without a map to rely on, you basically had to use your memory to find your way around the game. As you acquire these suits and weapons, you become stronger and can access certain rooms and gain entry to certain areas. Some of these are out in the open while others are concealed within the walls themselves so prepare to shoot your weapon everywhere. You eventually get to the last world where Mother Brain resides and fight it out until she's defeated.Just about everything about the game was and still is solid. The graphics, while primitive compared to today's standards, was top of the line as it was one of the launch games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The sound effects and music captured the mood while you're playing. The controls were responsive and do exactly what you wanted. The story was pretty basic but you got over it quickly. The game was pretty long so there was a password system in place. Whenever you die, you were given a password that you can use later to continue where you left off.This game was perfect for those who played it in its original cartridge form. It had been re-released later on with a different box cover, then ported to the Game Boy Advance and was included as an unlockable extra in the Gamecube title, \"Metroid Prime.\" Go play this game if you want to relieve good memories or if you haven't played it to begin with, see how it all started. ******HIGHLY RECOMMENDED******", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A solid NES title from the '80s era", "unixReviewTime": 1319587200, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2011"}

Why?  Cause I always ended up copying the stupid complicated password down wrong and could not continue.

I saw my parents playing it, and I had to play it of course. I think the thing that took my breath away the most was the idea of being able to play in one huge world and gain abilites by finding items. The difficulty was very high, so I had plenty reason to come back for more, as well. The GBA version of Metroid is much easier, in my opinion, due to the fact that you don't need to imput the passwords over and over again. That is the only flaw in this game: the passwords are confusing as heck. It uses lower and upper case letters, as well as a plethora of numbers and punctuation marks, so it is easy to write down something and get confused later on ( zeros look like o's...). Anyway, next to Super Metroid this is probably the greatest video game ever made, and expresses what a good video game is all about: Using your brain power to achieve something that is not only complicated, but fun. This is an open-ended game which is one huge level. Unlike Contra, Adventure Island and all those classic NES games, Metroid was one huge level which was intertwined and allowed the player to interract with the environment (ex: shooting a creature with the ice beam, then blowing a few blocks away above your head to reveal a hidden passage). It's hard to express how fun this game was, and still is.Graphics- 10/10 When it cam out, the graphics were top of the line and the environments look pretty awesome, especially the Norfair, Ridley, and Kraid environments. The backrounds are in many different textures and colors. Some environemts are downright creepy (the purple orbs in Norfair, and the purple drooping rock-esque things on the ceiling for example, or the big structures of the alien heads on the walls before you enter Kraids and Ridleys lairs, also the creepy structure before you fight Kraid and Ridley.), while others just fit in perfectly with the enemies and music themes. Each of the enemies has an interesting designs, and for its time the bosses were pretty cool.Music- 10/10 The Brinstar theme has got to be the catchiest and most memorable music theme out of any video game...ever. The other themes are great as well, especially the Kraid, Norfair, and Ridley themes. The music is quite atmospheric and sets the tone for the exploration quite perfectly, making it not only fun to explore, but pleasing to the ears as well. Music plays a big role in this game.Controls- 10/10 For its time, Metroid played extremely smooth, and Samus controlled great. It was one of, if not the first game to allow you to aim upward, making it a lot better. Sure you can duck down or aim diagnolly.. but this was NES, not Playstation 2, remember?Gameplay- 100/10 One hundred out of ten. This game took the idea of gameplay which was created by titles such as Super Mario Bros and just blew it away. There are countless items and powerups to collect, each uniquely hidden and well worth it. Metroid was the first game to really utilize exploration, unlike other games which were purely level-to-level. Sure, sometimes things are hidden in a ridiculous manor compared to games these days (having to blow away some random block to unveal the next room), but I think this only made the game more unique and durable. I mean, having to search for new rooms was not only thrilling, but it really made it feel like you were Samus embarking on a bounty hunter mission against the aliens of Zebes. Gameplay is absolutely flawless.Overall-10/10 This is probably the greatest NES game ever made, and I think everyone (kids or adults) should play this game, for it is not only brain-teasing, but is also quite fun. If you can look past its dated graphics and what-not, you will see that for its time everything was great, and to me it still looks as good as it did before.

The first Metroid game and only one to appear on the NES.Imagine that it is the year 1986. Nintendo had finally managed to break through the market with Super Mario Brothers the previous year, and it looked to be an uphill climb in greatness for the system. The NES was becoming a household name, and Nintendo was sure to release many more classics which would define the system. Metroid was one of these.Of all the spectacular 2D platform adventure games to be released throughout the last 20 years or so, such as the masterpieces Super Metroid, Castlevania Symphony Of The Night, Rygar, the GBA Castlevanias, Clash At Demonhead, and others, all of them owe their design to the popular original Metroid. While Super Mario Brothers technically invented the 2D action platform genre, and Zelda was a milestone for adventure gaming, up until Metroid there were no games that merged the two genres together. To put it simply, Metroid showed us a large sidescrolling environment with no \"levels\" so to speak, and combined it with items to collect and upgrade your character. For its day this was unheard of.Now I will go through the Positives, the Negatives, and the other Negatives that I consider to be overblown about Metroid...THE POSITIVES:-WELL DESIGNED GAME LAYOUT. Each area that you traverse is filled with lots of pathways, secrets, enemies, and powerups for you to collect. One thing I'm very impressed with for the game back in its day is that it's designed to prevent you from accessing certain areas without the aid of another ability/weapon. It also leaves you to think of ways to bypass some of these obstacles before you have these abilities. Very clever, Nintendo.-VERY DIVERSE ARRAY OF WEAPONS AND ABILITIES. For weapons, you've got the long beam, ice beam, and wave beam, which isn't a whole lot compared to other games, but enough to suit you for this adventure. Your abilities range from a hi jump, to a morph ball, to a protection suit, and to a damaging screw jump attack. Good enough for exploring the inner sanctums of Planet Zebes.-GOOD RANGE OF ENEMIES. While they tend to repeat themselves in different areas of the game, they do come in a variety of types. Most of them are very challenging, some are enough to make you pull your hair out, and others can be avoided altogether.-GREAT DIFFICULTY. This game is not an easy one, and its steep uphill learning curve will be loved and hated by many.THE NEGATIVES-THE ICEBEAM ACQUIRING LATER ON BECOMES FLAWED. What I mean is that every weapon you acquire replaces the one before it, and because of that, once you have your most powerful weapon, the wave beam, you'll be in trouble when you reach the final lair. You need the icebeam again when approaching the end of the game. Some may get frustrated with this aspect.-YOU CAN'T DUCK AND SHOOT! It becomes really annoying early in the game when you don't have the bomb yet and you need to shoot those spikey creatures on the ground and you can't.-THE BOSSES ARE TOO EASY. Well, Mother Brain is a bit tough because of all the stuff shooting at you, but Kraid and Ridley are both a bit disappointing because all you have to do is come close to both of them and just let loose with the missles.Now I'll address the Negatives that people have about the game that I think are just hot air:-THE GRAPHICS ARE OLD. People often say this about the game, but honestly, can you expect anything more from a game that came out in 1986? It works for the time. Though some of the environments can get a little bland in places, it's not that bad.-NO SAVE GAME FEATURE. Again, keep in mind that the year is 1986, and the only game that would've already had this feature is Zelda, which may or may not have come out before this game. The passwords can be tedious, but they save everything.-VERY LITTLE STORY. Once again, 1986. See a common theme here? If you think about it, the original Zelda really didn't have any bigger of a story to it either but nobody complained there. Same thing with Super Metroid. Plus, let's not forget how adding an in-depth story into the gameplay killed the freedom and pacing of Metroid Fusion.-NO MAP FEATURE. While having a map would help, the game isn't really all that intricate compared to Super Metroid, so by not having the map, the challenge factor bumps up and makes the game FEEL larger.Overall, Metroid is a flawed masterpiece, but a masterpiece nonetheless. If you feel like divulging in a historical yet essential classic of the NES, then Metroid should fill the gap nicely. This game already comes as a bonus to both Metroid Prime and Zero Mission, so you might as well save money and play those. While Zero Mission may be a better rendition of the original game, no one can deny the classic sensibilities of this NES shooter. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Other recommendations:-Any other sidescrolling Metroid title (Fusion, Super Metroid, Zero Mission, Metroid 2)-Any NES Mega Man game-Castlevania Symphony of the Night (PS1) and any of its GBA contemporaries (Circle, Harmony, Aria)-Rygar (NES)-Clash At Demonhead (NES)NOTE: For those who don't know, enter the password:JUSTIN BAILEY------ ------", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "4.5 stars - Definitely the first game of its kind", "unixReviewTime": 1118534400, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2005"}

A richly atmospheric title, METROID offered a darker, grainier side to the bright images and sunshine gaming that were at that time populating Nintendo.  (To this day Nintendo still specialises in that `sunshine gaming,' with more titles for little kids than adults, but that's rather beside the point).  SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, the 8-Bit's flagship title, was colourful, woefully short, and a fun jaunt to rescue Princess Toadstool from the evil Bowser.  SUPER MARIO BROTHERS displayed a mastery of excellent level design, but it did not take long to beat.  The rest of the video games at that time, san ZELDA and KID ICARUS, were also of a relative simple nature.Enter Samus Aran.  This was a game that offered unprecedented depth of play, was dark and grisly, and had great, mood setting music, and long, twisting corridors that led you deep into the Space Pirates' lair.  An incredibly large game for the time, comparable only to THE LEGEND OF ZELDA and KID ICARUS of the first generation Nintendo titles, you could wander around for hours, exploring and gaining access to new areas with new items.  I tend to think of KID ICARUS (why didn't this become a franchise???) and METROID as brothers, and ZELDA and METROID as first cousins.  While ZELDA offers a very innovative, opened-ended (for the time) overworld experience with fantasy elements, METROID does the same type of innovation for side-scrollers, with a map just as expansive (though in a different format) as ZELDA. Which brings me to the actual game play of METROID.Metroid operates as one long map broke off into sections.  There is no level progressions like Mario.  But the game does contain you too certain areas that only opens up after you had receive new items.  These items are cleverly hidden throughout the game's map, and just when you think you've come to a dead end, suddenly you bomb the floor and a whole new area opens before you.  And the game isn't too kind when it set you down in that opening area of Brinstar.  Equipped with only 30 energy units, Samus has to be tough to survive.  Energy is scarce and can be time-consuming to collect. (Compare obtaining life in METROID to SUPER METROID; in SUPER METROID there's all sorts of energy).  The energy being so hard to collect, and the ungodly complex password system, do flaw the game, but we have to remember this is a first gen NES title, so you have to cut it some slack.Now would be a good time to talk about METROID's glitch.  Much like the negative world in SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, METROID has one of the most famous glitches in the video gaming world.  Called the Secret Worlds, you use a wall jumping technique that enables you to get to \"new areas\" of the game that are otherwise unreachable.  Thought to be a secret, an intentional programming easter egg, these Secret Worlds, while still fun to search for, are not intentional.  They are glitches.  Search the Internet to find out all about these secret areas.After transversing Brinstar and Norfair, getting new items, then Samus has to fight through the two bosses' hideouts and put them down before the final confrontation: Mother Brain.  My favorite old school enemy, Mother Brain is a proven nemesis, much harder to beat than the laughably pathetic Bowser or even the more challenging Gannon.  On top of that, once you beat her you have to get out of Tourian within a certain time limit (admittedly, it's more than enough time to get out).  Even though Mother Brain's tough, we video gamers led Samus to victory countless times because of the stupendous game play and the compelling story.  Once Mother Brain is dead and we get Samus out of Tourian, then the real payoff is unleashed.  Samus is a WOMAN!  And if you beat the game under certain time limits, you get different endings.  During the days of rescuing damsels in distresses with a Brooklyn plumber or a green-clad boy, Samus's gender is very revolutionary, which brings me to the story aspect of METROID, which is currently under attack by ZERO MISSION.METROID's best features are successfully combines rich story-telling (for the NES) with innovative gameplay.  This isn't a kid's game like Mario.  This is a classic science fiction story, heavily influenced by Ridley Scott's ALIEN.  Metroid is a story of a Space Federation fighting for its very survival against the fearsome Mother Brain and its two subordinates, Ridley and Kraid, who had stolen the Metroids and had their own devious designs for them.  I have a sneaking suspicion that the boss Ridley was named after Sigourney Weaver's character and Ridley Scott.  Gunpei Yokoi, executive produce of METROID (and also one of the chief developers of the original Game Boy), said that while ALIEN was never specifically discussed during Metroid's development, it cast a heavy shadow over METROID.  That same dark terror, about never knowing what was around the next corner and how you were hoping, against all odds, that Ridley in ALIEN and Samus in the game would come out on top, forever cemented both tales in the imaginations of their prospective audiences.Because of the gameplay and atmospheric story, Samus Aran has become a classic video game icon.  Thankfully, after many long years the METROID franchise has become alive again with new releases.  But for those who want to relive the Samus's first glory, then this game would hold you enthralled.  This is truly a classic game.P. S. Unfortunately, do to the realitive simplicity of the NES version of events, Nintendo has saw fit to introduce a radical remake of the game on METROID: ZERO MISSION, enlarging it and changing around events.  While I enjoyed ZM, I felt it much to linear and went against what made the original so great to begin with: open-ended exploration.

I'm a 16 year old gamer and actually prefer old-skool myself. I think it's time we start reviewing a product for what it really IS rahter than how old it is.For its time, Metroid was a milestone in video gaming. One of the largest games when it was released that wasn't quite so linear. The game doesn't have a completely set path for you to take. You're supposed to get around by exploring the game and finding abilities. It is possible to find nearly every ability before you even fight your first boss.  This was also one of the first games to use the &quot;Password&quot; system. There were probably a a few before this.Also, what I like most about this game (and what the games these days need) is that its HARD! Should you play this game you'll be stunned at some of its difficult feets. Some things you must do to get abilities are amazingly hard, but well worth it.For 8-bit graphics these are amazing and some of the best on the NES I've seen.  This is by far one of the best NES games you could ever get.  The game is also HUGE that you MUST explore. If (when?) you die you always get a password displayed. Depending on what area you're in will depend on where you start.  For the NES using this system was a bit different at the time.Metroid is a milestone among games. Not to mention it had one of the most shocking moments in videogame history (that when I played, I myself was a bit shocked at the time), that being that Samus is a woman.  Sure nowadays its no big deal but when Metroid came out all the big heroes in games were male characters back in this time.  So while today it isn't shocking to see, back then it was.Overall, you'd have to be crazy not to be able to enjoy this game.

Except that some of the glitches the NES cartridge tends to have sometimes.-The other con...its too bad that compared to today it won't get what it deserves anymore.

First of all its very unintuitive.  When I rented this game as a kid, I had no freaking idea how to get past a red door.  In fact, I never even found any missles to blast the door down with, because the game's just so darn big, and many of the rooms you go through look exactly the same.  Its tough to find your way around.  I wouldn't even attempt to play this game without a map of some sort now.If you have any intention of progressing through certain points in the game, you absolutely have to go through secret passageways using bombs.  This is another thing that makes the game very unintuitive.  And for this reason, I wouldn't attempt to play the game without a walkthrough in addition to a map.And what's worse, even if you have your walkthrough and your map, there are areas in the game where you can get stuck indefinitely.  I tried to access a secret room by doing a bomb jump over a statue, and sure enough, I got stuck in a nook behind the statue and couldn't get out.  No matter what I did, I was stuck.  Talk about frustrating.  I shouldn't have to reset the game when I make a mistake like that.  At least give me a suicide option or something.Then there was another time I got an energy pack in a secret room, and when I tried to roll and explode my way back out of the secret room, I couldn't get out.  The last rock in my way refused to explode, and freaking bees kept flying at me while I was trying to escape.  Dog gone, why have a secret room at all if I can't get out of the darn thing?But despite all this, Metroid is a pretty good game.  Sure, there are times when you're swarmed by enemies that'll beat on you until you're forced to run away, but you've got to take the bad with the good sometimes.  Its fun to just run around, get all the special items, and shoot stuff.  When you have that jumping attack and the wave beam, man, you can plow through enemies like you're the Terminator.  Nothing can stand in your way.  Except those jelly fish things.  You can't screw around with those guys.I'm glad I gave this game another shot 20 years later.  It was a lot of fun.

Not wanting that kind of bad press directed at them, Nintendo re-released the game with Tyson being replaced by the crew-cut Mr. Dream, who shares the EXACT same punches and mannerisms as Tyson).Since I was given my first Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991, I have been a devoted brand-loyalist my entire life, playing such systems as the Super Nintendo, Nintendo '64, Gamecube, and the Wii. Through that lineage, I was able to see video games \"grow up\", in a manner of speaking, what with the introduction of 3-D game play with Mario '64, the explosion of the Madden Football series, and the new motion-sensor interface of the Wii. Yet, through all those great games and innovative ideas, it is still a simple boxing game that charms me every time.I think that the biggest appeal of \"Punch-Out!\" is its quirkiness. You play as Little Mac, a scrawny little fighter who must take on other pugilists both man and animal alike! There's Don Flamenco and his corny dances, Magic Tiger with his spinning knockout punch, and Bald Bull with his \"Bull Charge\". Plus, fighters like Piston Honda (obviously the Asian representative), Soda Popinski (a knock-off from the arcade game's Vodka Drunkenski, which Nintendo tamed down a bit), and Mr. Sandman are also quite colorful and interesting. With a cast of characters like that (including more that I'm not even mentioning here), how could the game not be engaging, as players wait breathlessly to see which oddball will come out of the woodwork next!Of course, the challenge of the game is also what keeps players coming back for more. At first, you will hardly be able to defeat \"Glass Joe\", a wimpy fighter who is little more than a punching bag. However, as you begin to learn the basic controls, you will be able to advance to the next fighter, who always has something else up his sleeve. Each fighter also has their own individual \"tells\" (Piston Honda's eyebrows, various sound cues, etc.), which (once studied) can give you an edge in defeating them. If you have not played this game, I cannot put into words the joyful feeling of, having toiled to defeat a particular fighter time and time again, you finally put him on the mat for good!About the only criticism I have of \"Punch-Out!\" is that, right at the very end, the difficulty level rises into the stratosphere. From Glass Joe to Super Macho Man and all fighters in between, they can be beaten by any decent gamer who puts in some time and effort. For Tyson/Dream, however, your reflexes need to be honed to nearly those of a cat in order to defeat him. However, that \"weakness\" also makes the game enjoyable after being defeated for the umpteenth time, as no matter how good you think you are, Tyson/Dream will give you the video game challenge of a lifetime.So, I would highly recommend this game to ANY video game enthusiast out there (not just boxing fans). In today's world of complicated games that often have side-quests that can seemingly last forever, it is refreshing to find a game that is so simple and straightforward, yet challenging and engaging.

You are Mike, who has just arrived at Coralcola to visit your uncle, Dr. J. You find out that he has been kidnapped and only you can save him.Mike goes through the game equipped with a yo-yo. It proves to be a powerful tool, and it only gets stronger further into the game. You will most likely encounter some frustrating puzzles that seemingly have no solution, but have patience with this game. It is worth it when you figure it out. You will be tasked with conquering undergroung tunnels full of monsters, a haunted graveyard and more. Overall there is enough to do to take many hours away from your life.This is my personal favorite NES game of all time, along with Mike Tyson's Punch-Out, and if I could rate it higher than 5 stars I would. It was everything a game should be and I had a lot of fun (and frustration) playing this game. This is an essential title for NES owners, and can usually be found for cheap (under 10 bucks).

These comfortable controllers proved very durable and well suited to long playing sessions.The NES boasts an absolutely HUGE library of games, including numerous classics like Contra, Metroid, Legend of Zelda, Castlevania, and of course the Super Mario Bros series. With its bright graphics and fast gameplay, the system excelled in practically every style of video game, from sports to arcade to RPGs. Although the system had its share of old standards like Pac-Man and Galaga, many titles were innovative and pushed the limits of 2D gameplay. It's also interesting to note that Nintendo closely controlled third-party game developers by reserving the right to manufacture the cartridges for the system (hence the Nintendo \"seal of quality\").All in all, this system was un-falcon-believable when it came out.

A time when graphics weren't overwhelming and violence wasn't as prevalent in video games.  (Yes, of course there was some, but not to the extent of, say, Grand Theft Auto and it's ilk.)  The games are easy to comprehend and play.  They're also easy and cheap to find at thrift stores.  All you have to do is clean them up and pop them in.  Many web sites offer PDF downloads of the manuals/instructions as well so don't worry that you don't get the game mint in the box.  The system and games are easy to maintain.  Anyone with a phillips head screwdriver and a q-tip with a dab of rubbing alcohol can keep games and system clean and blink-free.  New 72 pins can be easily installed for under 10 bucks - then your old system will play forever.  I particularly like the Role Playing Games and the ability to save games for future play.

Before the days of the NES and Nintendo, Atari and its 2600 VCS reigned supreme. And Atari could've stayed on top had it accepted Nintendo's request for Atari to market Nintendo's Famicom in the States. Well, around that time Warner Communications sold its Atari home division to the infamous Tramiel family who decided that Atari should be about computers, not video games. In 1985 Nintendo introduced the NES and thanks to a chubby Italian plumber named Mario, games were suddenly \"in\" again. Atari saw Nintendo's success and brought its 2600 Jr. and 7800 systems out of the mothballs(the Tramiels shelved these projects as soon as they took over Atari), but kids were hooked on Mario, not Pole Position....it was too little too late for Atari, and Nintendo went on to dominate the industry. There were some absolutely GREAT games for the NES. My favorites are the Mario series (original Mario Bros., Super Mario 1, Super Mario 2, Super Mario 3), the Zelda series, RC Pro Am, Punchout (it was Mike Tyson's Punchout for a while, but after Mike Tyson's conviction, the original version was recalled and renamed Punchout and in the game itself, ear-bitin' Mike was replaced by Mr. Dream), and Maniac Mansion. The only problem with the NES is its front-loading mechanism is prone to dust, dirt, and bent cartridge connectors...you would be better off finding the top-loading NES, but the top-loading NES is extremely rare.Although the Atari 7800 and the Sega Master System had better hardware technology than the NES, they lacked the one important thing that the NES had...not only a huge library of game, but also a huge library of good games. The 7800 had minimal support (rumor has it that the Tramiels spent a little in advertising for the 7800 versus the multi-million dollar campaigns that Nintendo made), and Sega wasn't much better with the Master System. It's true that Nintendo's \"third-party exclusivity\" contracts (which meant that if a third-party company made games for the NES, they made them only for the NES, and they couldn't make games for competing systems) severely hampered the libraries of the 7800 and SMS, but the 7800 was doomed anyway (the Tramiels simply didn't care and basically ran the company into the ground until they sold the company to JTS), and SMS games were usually bad. The NES had its share of turkeys (one word of advice...steer clear of games made by unlicensed company Color Dreams [aka Wisdom Tree]...their games are so bad it's pathetic) but IMHO their good games outweighed the bad games.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "single-handedly resurrected the U.S. videogame market", "unixReviewTime": 989971200, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2001"}

Awesome Nintendo, not only for making a classic, but the next system SNES stacks on top of it so well.  One thing I will say negative about I don't know how much it matters, but the controller's D pad seems to sometimes not respond.
